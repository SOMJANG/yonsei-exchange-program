"LBS is located in London, England.  It is Northwest of the central London area -- beside a famous park called Regent’s Park.  The school is a “professional” business school.  Its population is roughly 1000 people – a very rough guest.  Roughly 80% of the school is composed of its M.B.A. students (including both Full-Timers and Part-Timers).  The other 20% of the school is comprised of PhD. students, Masters in Finance (MiF) students, and Sloan students.  Sloans are business students who are generally more mature, or older, that have a large degree of professional experience, but not necessarily a business background.LBS is located in a very exclusive area of London.  The closest subway station (tube-stop) is called Baker Street station.  It is about 5 to 10 minutes walking distance from LBS.  The area around Baker Street is very much a “touristy” area and, accordingly, there are many shops and restaurants in this part of town.  The area just around the school is somewhat empty as far as restaurants and shops are concerned.  Thus, for more of a selection for food, you must walk back towards the Baker Street station businesses for more of a selection.Famous for its depressing and/or miserable weather, London was not so bad when I visited.  It did rain a bit when I first arrived, but the weather was not as bad as I thought it would be as it was the spring season.  I was able to often wear shorts to school; however, I did have to bring an umbrella out with me quite often.","Around the campus: As mentioned, the campus is incredibly small, thus, one walks everywhere.Around the city: Most people use the subway, which is quite convenient, but somewhat expensive relative to Seoul.How to get to distant places: It depends on what your budget is.  But, if you ask any students they will assist you.  It may be worth buying a “international student ID” card from the exchange office.  It will offer you discount(s) if you buy Euro-Rail tickets or EuroStar tickets.  The cost is about 10,000 won.Sightseeing -- What things are worth seeing nearby?  In London, there are “tour-buses” everywhere.  Just hop on one, one Saturday, go to a bunch of places, and the places that you really like, just go back one day to “specialise” your day by yourself.Shopping: Good shopping is everywhere in London.Shows/musicals: you are in London. You should try to see one show, if you can.Movies: theatres are everywhere.Pubs/Bars: you’re in “London”.  You will find bars everywhere.Clubs/Discos: “Trendy” clubs are expensive and there are “line-ups” to get in.  Ask a local person which club is “currently” in.Places to avoid: Be aware and cautious of a place called Soho.  If you go during the “day” it is ok.  Once you’ have gone during the day, you will “understand” why it is somewhat dangerous at night.  (I will not elaborate.)","Since LBS is such a small school, there are not many places on the site to eat.  In fact, there are only three places to eat.  There is a cafeteria located in the basement below the student lounge, a sandwich shop, and a restaurant called “Boaters”, which is beside the sandwich shop.  Needless to say, there is no place on or near the campus to eat “Korean” food.  Thus, you will have to bring your own ko-chu-chang if you want to add some spice to your food.","While at LBS, I concentrated on strategy courses.  LBS is recognized for their academia in strategy and finance; their reputation in the area of marketing is lacking.  Relative to Yonsei’s GSIS program, LBS course load was heavily based on “cases” and the resulting discussions from them.  There were usually at least two cases to be read and prepared for each lecture.  Moreover, the aspect of classroom discussion and “participation” in the class was paramount.  In order to be recognized as a reasonable student, one “had” to be involved in the classroom discussions and debates.  The professors and courses I had were as follows:Don Sull, Leading Strategic Transformation: Professor Sull was an incredibly charismatic lecturer.  His lectures were interesting and “entertaining”.  My experience in his class was a good one.  His teaching style was appreciated by most, but disliked by a certain few.  He was considered a bit arrogant by most.  He, indeed, made the students “think” and consider very practical issues.  The course was based on “cases” which were supplemented with questions one had to have prepared prior to class.  “Cold-calls” took place during each class -- for most classes at LBS for that matter.  Homework also comprised of doing an analysis of a case according to the supplemental questions for any of the 5 sessions.  So long as one handed five of them in, one passed the course.  How one differentiated them selves was through the classroom discussion(s).Paul Geroski, Pascal Courty, Analysis of Industry and Competition: While Mr. Geroski was a great lecturer, Mr. Courty lacked the skills of an experienced and top-tier lecturer.  The class and course content, though, were good.  Again, the course material was based on various cases that the professors had chosen as the reading material.  The cases were discussed in class.  Moreover, there was a group project, and finally an end of the term take-home exam based on the cases that were discussed throughout the lectures.Rajendra Srivastava, Strategic Brand Management:  This was a great class taught by a guest lecturer over four days -- on two weekends (Saturday and Sunday).  Each day’s lecture was from 9am through to 5pm.  The professor was good, but the content was better.  The course was based on selected cases that one had to read and prepare for each class.  There was one major assignment based on one of the cases and one in-class exam.Julian Birkinshaw, Strategy II: Professor Birkinshaw was a good lecturer who based his lectures on the input from the students.  This proved to be an interesting way to present a lecture.  His style was very casual and friendly.  There was a group project and in-class presentation of the project.Throughout all of the classes at LBS I did not need any assistance in my english since it is my first language.  I would suggest, too/though, that no students would “appreciate” having to proof read other student’s work.  Moreover, there is no recognized place where one can get the assistance.  However, if one wanted to “pay” for a proofreader, one could simply put a notice up on a bulletin board and hope for a reasonably competent English writer to come to the aid.The Library at LBS is excellent – it is indeed a world-class business school’s library.  It is logically organised and easy to use.  Moreover, I always found that the library staff to be very helpful.  Learning how to use the library is a matter of reading signs (in English) and asking for help when required.","In regards to the Exchange Office at LBS, the person with whom I dealt was named Catherine Gibbs.  She was helpful, but there were times where I had to keep on top of her to get things done.  She is a busy woman, so receiving e-mails back from her required some patience.  It would be a good idea to keep track of all one’s correspondence with her (i.e.; e-mails, etc) in order to have a record of what one has asked, and if or when it was responded to.  Frankly, it was a very difficult experience getting this exchange organised.","Mail: the exchange office will organise a “mail-box” for your post-mail.Banking:  I set up an account at a bank called “Barklays”.  I had to be “less than honest” with them in order to open an account, since they are not fond of people opening up accounts for short periods like 4 months.  Once it was set up, things were convenient.  I had a cash card and an “account” where moneys could be wired to.Bookstore:  is right beside the main entrance – you cannot miss it.  It is the same place where one can buy LBS souvenirs, too.Computer Centre: There are 2 main computer centres and many small conference rooms with computers throughout the small campus. All have Internet access.  Because the campus is so small, everything is quite easy to find.  To give you an idea, the entire LBS campus is smaller than the main Yonsei Library.Chapel and Religious Services: London is a multi-cultural city.  Thus, if you “want” to, you “can” find services of any type throughout the city.  Moreover, if you are a Korean “Christian”, there are several Korean churches in the city.  There are several “Korean” students attending LBS, who can assist you in these regards.Advice from Professors or counsellors: Such services are abundant at LBS.  One just has to ask the Exchange officer for assistance in whatever regards one needs help.",,,"London was expensive -- incredibly expensive.  For example, using the “Big Mac” index, a Big Mac in London cost roughly 5000 Korean won.  The dormitory in which I stayed was small, clean, and provided both breakfast and dinners at a cost of roughly $1000 American per month.  During my exchange, books, binders, and course materials were supplied by the school administration.  The school was incredibly well organised in regards to the materials that were to be given to the students.  The cost of living in London is extraordinarily expensive; thus, be prepared to spend 10,000 Korean won for a very “basic” meal.  London Business School, to my understanding, did not offer any “on-campus” dormitory services.Use your common sense, and you should be fine.  Consider which “season” of the year you are going in and bring the appropriate clothes.  London is famous for its rain and depressing weather, but the spring was fine.Food: in this regard, you must know “yourself” what type of foods you might miss.  This is completely up to the “individual”.I would suggest that as opposed to reading “this” report, you should consider buying a travel book about “London”, England, and even Europe.  Read it, and keep notes about things you should not forget to bring or consider.Finally, there is a “group” of LBS students that “will be” Korean.  Send them an e-mail by asking the LBS exchange co-ordinator for the “leader” of the LBS Korean student’s association.  It is not too formal of a group, but they were incredibly helpful towards myself."
