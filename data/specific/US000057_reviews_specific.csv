"Dartmouth is a small college of about 6000. Located in Hanover, a rural town in the mountains of New Hampshire, it is quite far from many big cities such as Boston (3 hours away by bus) and New York (5 hours). Thus, it is a bit difficult to get out of campus unless one has a car or a bicycle. The Appalachian mountains pass by the school, and many students and hikers frequent the trails and lodges scattered throughout the premises. Perhaps because it is so mountainous, Hanover becomes very cold during the winter, often going down below -20'C. Heavy snow starts from the end of fall term until mid to late March. While I was there, it did not snow too often but when it did the snowfall was heavy. Because the school takes care to clean necessary paths within the school, getting around was not much of a problem for me though I would recommend waterproof boots. On the bright side, the summers do not become unbearably hot and the air is fresh and largely free from light pollution.","Dartmouth recently lost its closest bookstore, but there is a second hand bookstore and Norwich Bookstore about an hour's walk away. There is a small cinema in town. CVS was where we got many manufactured products. The school Coop suffices for necessary groceries.There are a few restaurants in town, mostly on the $15-20 range. My roommates and I loved the Indian and Thai restaurants. There is a ""Korean"" restaurant called Sushiya. The Dartmouth Coach was my only way to get out of town; it connects the school to New York and Boston (South Station and Boston Logan Airport).","I lived in two dorms in my time there: Woodward (part of North Park House) and Andres (East Wheelock House). Being an old school, Dartmouth has many old buildings and dorms. These two buildings were relatively new. There is no air conditioning in some of the dorms though heating is everywhere. Dorms are decided by detailed surveys and whether one would like substance free housing and/or gender inclusive ones.","There are many libraries in Dartmouth, but I only went to the largest one, Baker-Berry. The interior can become extremely confusing, so I would recommend signing up for a tour sometime in the beginning of the term. This library has multiple floors of fabulous books and is connected to Borrow Direct, a system that connects Ivy League school libraries that allows you to order books from other schools. Dartmouth students take two to four classes each term, of which there are four in a year. The recommended class load is three per term, and many students prefer to not take all three courses from one department to diversify their load. I took four classes my winter term, and though I loved them all I regretted not being able to put in substantial work for each class. I took War Stories, ""Zombies, Cyborgs, and Clones,"" Arts of Laughter (Fall); Catastrophe and Human Survival, Introduction to Literary Theory, 19C Russian Literature, French 1 (Winter); Narrative Journalism, Weird Fiction and the Limits of the Human, and French 2 (Spring). Dartmouth has a fantastic intensive language program that will help you pick up languages quickly and efficiently and the French faculty were extremely supportive. The English Literature department is also fabulous and I regret not being able to take more challenging classes. The literature theory class was a great and comprehensive introduction to theory and philosophy important to literature, The other literature classes and the Catastrophe class were also brilliant and allowed me to becomes sincerely interested in climate studies, but alas the professors for three of these classes left Dartmouth. Almost every professor I had gave detailed feedback for my essays.","OPAL, Ms. Danielle Hussey, and Ms. Marcia Calloway will help with many concerns or will direct you do someone who can help.","Clubs are not as big at Dartmouth as they are at Yonsei, but there are a number of them. I was a seldom participant in Stonefence Review, a literary magazine, and Humbug, the creative writing club. I got to meet many intelligent and impossibly creative people through these clubs and wish that I had joined more. There are many kinds of athletic clubs as well, with both beginning and competitive members. The school and sororities/fraternities host many events that people are welcome to attend.","Having graduated from an American high school, I was not that surprised by the things I ran into at Dartmouth.","Apart from the people you can contact for international affairs I listed above, you can go to many other people for help such as academic deans and mental health counselors. For more academic concerns, feel free to ask your professors as many of them are responsive to questions. Or you could also contact the tutoring center or RWIT (writing center, run by students).",Ask me anything at emilyy1125@gmail.com !
"Dartmouth is not the best place to go if one is looking to be well-connected with city life. However, I was not looking to be well-connected with city life, so I was fine. I found the weather also less cold than many who went before me said it would be. However, during the winter, there's a lot of snow. Boots would be good.","It was a small college town where there was not much going on. My fellow exchange student and roommate found Hanover *very* boring. As someone who went there primarily to study in solitude, however, I did not find the area particularly suffocating. I especially appreciated that there was a yoga studio within walking distance, since being able to continue doing yoga was a particular concern of mine. I also loved to spend hours at the Barnes and Nobles: I would sit there in the corner for hours and read books. The people working at there did not seem to particularly mind.","I really loved my dorm at MacLaughlin Cluster, Byrne Hall. I had no problems with it. However, I do realize that I was extremely lucky to have been assigned there. Perhaps this was not the case for other students who went before me, or after me. As a vegan, I also loved that Dartmouth had a great salad bar. There were many vegetarian friendly options. I loved both Collis and Foco, and the menu options there.Note: Upon reflection, I would have much preferred to be on the 5 meal swipe-per-week plan, than the 20 meal swipe-per-week plan. I only ate one big meal at dinner every day, and I'd get fruits and snacks for breakfast. Having more DBA would have been a lot less wasteful, because I would not only have meal-swipes that I didn't use, but also, I would want snacks at different times of the day. When I just wanted a snack, I would have to wait for the meal-time to change from, say, breakfast to lunch, or lunch to dinner, if I didn't want to waste my meal-swipes; otherwise, if I could not wait, I often paid my own money or went minus on DBA, which means I also paid my own money, after I used all my DBA. This probably does not make any sense to someone who is reading, however. All this will make sense once you are there.","For me, the classes and the professors at Dartmouth were the best part about Dartmouth: I learned so much. I was dying to take all the classes that interested me, and the result was a lot of intellectual growth. Sometimes it was disheartening when I felt that my classmates were a lot smarter and more well-read than me. But little pains of feeling small, all ultimately contributed to what was, overall, an incredibly positive experience. I especially enjoyed an ENG class in which I read Quentin Meillassoux's After Finitude, which shaped the academic/philosophical interests I had after taking the class. I took a WGSS/PHIL class that changed my life, in which I basically learned about Husserlian phenomenology from a brilliant philosophy professor (who unfortunately is not at Dartmouth anymore). I also loved a HIST class in which I learned about American capitalism from 1970s, in which I learned more about neo-liberalism and the era in which we live from an incredibly smart history professor. These three classes were incidentally the only classes I got an ""A"" from. (For the rest of the classes, I got ""A-""s. However, I was relatively okay with not getting the best grades possible, because I knew I wanted to just let myself have fun learning.)  Other than that, I took two seminars from the GOVT department: one in which we read the Anglophone contemporary political theory (Rawls, Nozick, Walzer, Iris Marion Young, etc.) and one in which we read Continental political theory (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Arendt, etc.). I took broad intellectual history survey courses in the HIST and SOCY departments. And I took a class on Wittgenstein.  I also loved the library. I'm sad that I did not explore its little corners sooner.",-,I wasn't a part of any clubs and organizations. I literally spent my entire time there studying.,I wish I had interesting stories to tell about all the shocking things I encountered at Dartmouth. But I didn't really experience anything that particularly shocking.,"For me personally, I talked to a lot of professors, because I really wanted to learn about their fields of interest, and to receive advice about my career prospects. However, for more general help, I think the students at Dartmouth are civil, and are generally willing to help you out if you don't know about something. I must say though, I don't think I required a lot from the school. Again, I came to Dartmouth mostly to spend my time studying in a room. Perhaps if another student required and asked more from the school, they would encounter more trouble with the administration.",*******@gmail.com
"The campus itself is quite small, similar to that of Yonsei's international campus in Songdo. Dartmouth's falls are beautiful, where the trees turn colors and people can enjoy the moderate temperatures. I recommend having lunch on the Green (a large grass field on campus where people eat, enjoy reading, walk their dogs) during the nice weathers. However, the winters are extremely brutal, where the lows can go down to negative 20 degrees celsius or even lower- long padded parkas and snow boots are a must. During the winters, students can enroll in PE classes like skiing or ice skating which I also recommend.","Dartmouth is located in such an isolated area with only one main street (consisting of restaurants and various shops and a CVS) right in front of the school. The closest shopping area (including a Wallmart, JC Penny, a small Sephora, etc.) is around 20 minutes by car, but you need a car to get there. There is almost no such thing as public transportation, so without a car it's extremely difficult to get away from campus. Personally, this was the most difficult part of my experience in Dartmouth, as I'm a person who enjoys the activities cities provide. Dartmouth's surroundings very much scream nature, so if you're a city-person, this is definitely not the place for you. Students usually, when they want to get in touch with civilization again, go to Boston which is a two-hour, $38 trip from campus (one-way, so not including the fee back). Near Dartmouth, there's a river where people go for a swim or go canoeing, and there are plenty are hiking trails if one needs some outdoors exercise.","Most students live on campus and of course exchange students are assigned dorm rooms. There are many different dorm buildings on campus and some are definitely better than others. Do not think of the nice dorm rooms Yonsei offered at Songdo. Luckily, I was assigned to one of the nicer dorm buildings (Mclaughlin Cluster). However, most rooms do not have inside bathrooms and it is most likely that you will have to share bathrooms with your floormates. Unlike Yonsei's dorms, male and female students are assigned the same floors, so like me, the neighbors in front of you may be of the opposite sex. In terms of food, students are enrolled in a dining plan and they can choose the plan that fits their eating habits. Each dining plan usually consists of ""swipes"" and ""DBA."" For example, ""the 20"" refers to having 20 meal swipes per week. Each day has three swipe periods (breakfast, lunch, dinner), and once you use a swipe for that period of that day you cannot use it again for the same period, you must wait for the next period. Originally, one meal swipe is to be used for the cafeteria on campus, which people refer to as Foco, (you can get into foco with one meal swipe) but you can also use a swipe at different food places for a set value. So for example, if lunch is $7.75, you would grab food that would add up to around $7.75 and you can use a meal swipe. DBA is like a balance account with a set amount of money at the beginning of the term. ""The 20"" includes $175 of DBA for a term, and you can use this anywhere on campus at the dining places. For more details and a better explanation, visit this site: http://www.dartmouth.edu/dining/plans/Now moving on to the actual places you can go to eat on campus, first there is the cafeteria or foco (short for food court). On Dartmouth sites, this will be referred to as the Class of 1953 Commons. This is an all-you-can-eat buffet style dining place where the menus change everyday. They have a salad bar, DIY station, pizza station, vegetarian section, grill section, main dish section, and a dessert section. They also have this ""food around the world"" section where they serve random foods around the world. Sometimes they serve bibimbap but I would not recommend it- the 고추장 is so wrong. Honestly, I never really enjoyed foco and just stuck to salad and chicken breasts. A tip would be to check the menus everyday beforehand so you can strategically use your meal swipes.Second, Collis Cafe also has a variety of food. People usually go for stir-frys, pasta at dinner, or their omelets. They also have a salad bar and serve sushi. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend anything else than the stir-fries.Third, Courtyard Cafe, or more commonly called the HOP because it's at the HOP, is more of a grill-based dining place. The menus are heavily meat-based and there are a lot of burgers and burger-like menus. However, there are also a salad bar and a sandwich station, and students can get fresh fruit. Personally, I really enjoyed using the sandwich station; it's like at Subway where you tell the person what kind of bread you want and what you want in your sandwich. Fourth, Novak Cafe is more like a cafe where you would go to get a quick coffee or a drink. (as a side note, the coffee is extremely bad here.) But for a quick breakfast/lunch you could get a cold sandwich or a bagel. Bagels, you could toast yourself; sandwiches, you could ask to be toasted. There was also a very popular bakery on campus called KAF. It's located in the baker-berry library and always full of people. If you wanted to get good coffee, this is the place you'd go. People also had sandwiches and salads for a quick lunch. They also have a lot of drinks that aren't on the menu, so a tip would be to always listen to what others order. Some of my favorites were an Arnold Palmer and chocolate milk with a shot. KAF does not receive meal swipes so Dartmouth students usually spend a lot of their DBA here. Outside of campus, there is a main street with multiple restaurants. Usually students eat on campus since they have already paid for their meal plan and eating out is quite expensive. There is, however, a Korean-Japanese place called Sushiya where Korean students often go to when they need something spicy. When you're so sick of ""American"" food, this is the place to go. (I wouldn't compare it to food here in Korea, but it is what it is. I was just thankful that there was a Korean place in such a remote area.)The dorms usually do have kitchens so if you have the utensils and the ingredients, cooking is possible. There is a Co-op, a grocery market, near the school so if cooking is your thing and you're okay with a 20 minute walk, go for it!","The classroom environment is very much like that of UIC’s. The Government (or PSIR in UIC) professors are all well-recommended by Dartmouth students, and the government classes I took were also great. Government classes are usually lecture and discussion based with lots of readings, pop-quizzes, essays, and exams. I would also like to recommend the language courses they offer at Dartmouth if one has the time. Dartmouth is known for their language courses and I would extremely recommend them!The library is usually where people socialize and do work. There are different floors and sections in the library where some places are more for socialization and others are more for work and therefore quiet.",-,There are a variety of clubs on campus and it’s not difficult to join one.,"The main ""culture shock"" would have been that I had to use a bathroom and shower room outside of my dorm room.",-,-
"다트머스 대학은 뉴햄프셔 주의 하노버 시에 위치한 대학입니다. 학교 옆에 위치한 커네티컷 강을 건너면 바로 버몬트 주로 넘어갈 수 있습니다. 기후는 한국에 비해서 가을이 빨리 찾아오고, 겨울이 길며, 봄이 늦게 찾아오지만, 2015년에는 이상기후로 인해 오히려 한국보다 겨울이 짧았고 연말까지 눈이 오지 않았습니다. 가장 가까운 대도시는 차로 두시간 반 거리에 있는 보스턴인데, Dartmouth Coach나 Greyhound 버스를 타고 갈 수 있습니다. Dartmouth Coach는 뉴욕 맨하튼 직행 버스도 운행하는데, 편도 5시간이 걸립니다. 대학교 캠퍼스는 평지에 위치해 있어 이동하기 매우 편리하지만 가끔 다음 수업이 캠퍼스 반대편에 있는 경우 학생들은 자전거를 타고 다니기도 합니다. 하지만 2016 - 2017 부터는 이동시간을 늘리기 위해 쉬는 시간을 15분으로 늘린다고 합니다.","하노버는 매우 한적한 캠퍼스 타운이라서 Main Street 에 있는 상권 외에는 모두 대학 관련 건물들입니다. 다른 도시로 차를 타고 가야 색다른 환경을 볼 수 있습니다. 대중교통으로 할것 같으면 주에서 무료로 운행하는 마을버스가 있는데, 버스 정류장 표시가 자칫하면 지나치기 쉬워서 미리 컴퓨터로 가는 길을 잘 공부하고 버스 운전사분들의 도움을 받으며 하노버를 벗어날 수 있습니다. 대형 마트가 모두 West Lebanon이라는 인근 도시에 위치해 있지만 버스로 돌아 가게 되면 40분쯤 걸리며 환승도 해야 합니다. 한국 핸드폰을 미국에서 쓰신다면 역시 West Lebanon에 있는 AT&T에서 칩을 구매할 수 있습니다. 하지만 이 마을 버스도 오후 6시면 모두 끊기고 배차간격도 30분~1시간씩 되기 때문에 수업이 끝나자 마자 바삐 볼일을 보러 이동해야 막차를 놓치지 않을 수 있습니다.개인 자가용이 있지 않는 이상 학교 밖으로 나가는 것이 제한적이기 때문에, 되도록 모든 구매는 온라인으로 하게 됩니다. 학생마다 고유 우편함(Hinman Mailbox)이 주어집니다. 이곳을 통해 모든 소포와 우편을 받을 수 있습니다.","모든 교환학생들은 기숙사에서 살게 됩니다. 기숙사는 여러 형태가 있는데, 자신의 성향을 잘 파악해서 방의 종류를 미리 조사한 후 방 수요조사에 참여하시기 바랍니다. 개인실부터 4명이 한방을 쓰는 등의 여러 종류가 있는데, 각 학기가 끝나고 다시 방배정을 받을 때 바꿀 수도 있어서 유연하게 대처할 수 있습니다.식사는 학교에 선불로 낸 식비를 차감해가면서 쓰는 Meal Plan 중 Meal Swipe와 DBA의 비율을 정해서 한 학기 동안 씁니다. 모든 학교 내 식사는 다트머스에 온 첫날 만드는 학생증을 제시해야 선불로 낸 식비로 식사를 할 수 있습니다. 학교 밖에 나가서 식사를 할 수도 있습니다. 도시가 작은 만큼 종류가 다양하지는 않지만, 있을 것은 다 있습니다. 북미의 tip문화가 처음에는 익숙하지 않을 수 있지만, 서버들이 시간당 최저임금도 받지 못하는 경우가 많기 때문에, 서비스를 받았다면 팁을 10%이상 남기는 것이 문화입니다.","수강신청은 많은 학생들이 휴학을 마치고 돌아오는 봄학기에 더 치열해집니다. 가을이나 겨울 학기에는 학생들이 인턴십을 하기 위해 휴학을 많이 내기 때문에 수강신청에 여유가 있습니다. 한 학기에 주로 세 개의 수업을 듣는것이 일반적이며, 원한다면 2개만 들을 수 있고 4개까지 들을 수 있습니다. 저는 경제학과이기 때문에, 또 학점이 걱정되어 연대에서는 조심스럽게 들었을 수업들을 겁없이 여러개 신청해서 원없이 경제학을 공부했다고 자부할 수 있습니다. 뿐만 아니라 고등학교때 전공했던 스페인어를 다시 복습할 수 있었습니다. 미국의 제2언어라고 불리는 스페인어인 만큼 다른 어떤 외국어보다도 수업들이 많이 개설되고 배우는 학생들도 많습니다. 복수전공에 해당되는 수업들을 들으려 하다 보니 Government (정치외교학) 수업도 여럿 듣게 되어서 UIC의 Common Curriculum을 듣던 저학년 때와 달리 전공에 집중하는 시기가 되었습니다. 도서관은 제일 큰 Baker-Berry가 캠퍼스의 중심에 위치해 있으며, 그 외에도 캠퍼스 이곳 저곳 소규모 도서관들이 숨어 있습니다.","교환학생들이나 국제학생들의 비자문제를 담당하는 OVIS는 9월 초에 International Student Orientation을 진행하는데, DOC Trip의 Exchange/Transfer Section과 날짜가 겹쳐서 저는 오리엔테이션에 참여하지 않았습니다. 비자 관련된 중요한 날짜들을 상기시켜주며, 다트머스에 잘 적응 하는 방법을 알려주고, 또 다른 학생들과의 교류의 장이 된다고 들었습니다. 또 학교 내에서 직업을 가지게 되어 소득이 생기면 Payroll Office에 가서 본인이 근로를 할수 있는 신분을 가진 자임을 증명해야 합니다. 한국에 주민등록증이 있듯이, 미국에서 체류하는 기간 내에 Social Security 번호를 취득한다면 행정적인 업무가 쉬워질 수 있습니다.","다트머스는 아이비리그인 만큼 우수한 학생들 뿐만 아니라 체육선수들이 많이 있습니다. 각 스포츠 마다 선수팀이 있고 클럽이 있는데, 클럽은 간단한 테스트와 의지를 보여주면 가입할 수 있는 곳입니다. 저는 여성수구클럽을 가입해서 매주 두번씩 수구를 연습하곤 했습니다. 또한 수많은 자치단체들이 있어서 언제든지 관심을 보이면 참여할 수 있습니다. 저는 Dartmouth MUN에서 안전보장이사회의 의장을 맡았고, 또한 다트머스는 아이비리그 학교 중에 유일하게 한국어 수업이 없는 학교라서 한국계 미국인 학생들 중심으로 운영되는 한국어 학당 (Korean Language School)에서 고급반 강사를 맡았습니다. 또한 Tutor Clearinghouse라는 1:1 과외 매칭 사이트를 통해 경제학입문 수업 과외가 필요한 학생들 여럿에게 개인 과외수업을 하기도 했습니다.","저는 다트머스를 가벼운 마음으로 왔지만, 1년이 지나고 떠나 와서는 얼마나 많은 경험을 하게 되었는지 되돌아 볼수록 놀랍습니다. 연세대학교에서 저학년 시절을 보낼때와는 전혀 다른 생활을 하게 되어서 급격한 변화에 잘 적응만 하더라도 성공적인 교환학생 시절을 보냈다고 할 수 있습니다. 수업들은 10주가 한 학기이기 때문에 항상 과제들이 많고, 수업 시간이 부족해서 혼자 공부해야 하는 부분이 많습니다. 교수님들은 모두가 꼭 알아야 하는 부분에 대해서만 가르쳐 주시고, 수업에서 우수한 성적을 거두기 위해서는 혼자 책을 연구해야 하는 시간이 많아야 했습니다. 또한 학교 외의 유흥 시설이 없다보니 fraternity나 sorority 중심으로 네트워킹이 진행되고, 가끔은 이런 경로로 사람들을 만나는 것은 만나는 사람들의 수는 많아도 그 깊이는 얇아서 그에 대한 회의감을 느낄 때도 있었습니다. 5주 정도 되는 겨울방학때에는 멕시코에서 살면서 스페인어를 매일같이 쓰면서 생활해보기도 했고, 2주 정도 되는 봄방학때에는 퀘벡의 산골로 가서 텐트를 치고 자면서 스키를 타며 꽁꽁 얼은 강가 위에 쌓인 새 눈을 처음으로 밟으며 탐험에 나서기도 했습니다. 또한 주말에는 캐나다나 미국 전역에 있는 친구들을 보기 위해 몬트리올, 워싱턴, 뉴욕, 보스턴, LA, 필라델피아 등을 버스와 비행기를 타면서 짧은 여행도 다녔습니다. 연세대학교 송도캠퍼스에서 만든 수많은 동기들과 정신없이 보내던 저학년 시절과는 달리 혼자 다니는 시간이 굉장히 많아졌고, 그 시간 동안 자기 개발을 하거나 여행을 다니거나 미래에 대한 설계도 할 수 있었습니다.","다트머스에 오기 전까지 모든 일을 혼자 해내려는 성격이었던 저는 해외에 처음으로 혼자 살게 되면서 마주하게 되는 행정적인 업무의 비효율성이나 언어장벽, 문화차이에서 오는 외로움 등을 혼자 버티기 보다는 주변 사람들과 대화를 나누며 해소하는 것이 더 현명하다는 것을 머리로만 알았다가 실천에 옮기게 되었습니다. 위급한 상황이 일어나면 언제든 전화를 걸어 도움을 요청할 수 있는 Safety and Security, 고민이 있으면 들어주실 학과장님, 진로에 대해서 자신의 경험도 흔쾌히 나눠주실 교수님들, 그리고 문화적으로 공통분모가 있어서 더 친해지기 쉬운 한국계미국인 친구들 모두에게 열린 마음을 가지고 다가간다면 다트머스의 생활이 더 수월할것입니다.",기타 질문이 있으시면 언제든 연락 주세요!chorok1030@naver.com
"Dartmouth College is located in New England in the state of New Hampshire, about 2.5 hours away (via car) northwest of Boston. It is the smallest of the IVY league institutions, with roughly over 6,000 students enrolled. The buildings on campus are less than 10~15 minute walking distance from each other.Although many of the buildings on campus are quite old, they are cozy and beautiful. Baker-Berry Library with its Baker Tower is located at the central area overlooking the Green, which is the grass-covered common area, considered to be the ""heart"" of the campus. On the outer edge of the left side of campus runs the Connecticut River.The weather at Dartmouth is not very consistent year-round. Dartmouth is especially known (perhaps notorious) for its long and cold New England winters, although when I arrived towards the end of August, it was still pretty hot. The weather quickly turns chilly by the middle or end of September, and it tends to rain pretty often. The first snow usually comes by the middle of November, before the Fall term ends and stays at late as mid-April. Despite the cold weather, my favorite times of the year were the beginning of fall, as New Hampshire is known for its beautiful fall foliage, and also the end of spring, when the campus starts buzzing with life again.*Recommended for packing: rain boots, rain jacket, waterproof/snowproof winter boots, a warm goose-feather winter jacket, winter gloves, scarves/mufflers, warm socks, warm Heat-tech <x-layers*helpful tip: the International Students Affairs Office puts on a winter clothes drive during the winter for international students, where international students who are unfamiliar with the harsh winter weather can pick up second-hand winterwear (coats, boots, gloves, etc.) for free of charge","The campus itself is part of a small, cozy, quiet retiree town called Hanover. There is literally one main street in Hanover, which is even called ""Main Street."" Here, you can find a handful of restaurants (including a Korean restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Morano Gelato, etc.) and shops, and just about one of everything- one post office, one movie theater, one CVS, which is the 24-hour convenience store next to the one gas station. About a 30~40 minute car-ride away from Hanover, there is a small ""city"" called Lebanon, where there is a Walmart and a few other outlet stores. There is free accessible public transportation (called Advance Transit) from Hanover to Lebanon that operates during weekdays.  There are also more restaurants in (West) Lebanon, such as Panera Bread, McDonald's, KFC, Applebee's, etc. and a popular yummy ice-cream place called Icecream Fore-You. If you get a chance to explore off-campus, the best way to get around would be via a friend's personal car or by renting a zipcar (you would need to have a driver's license). Some places that are well-known are Ben and Jerry's Icecream factory and King Arthur Flour, both which are located across the Connecticut River in the state of Vermont.","Dartmouth is a residential college, so students mostly live in dorms.In past years, exchange students were normally assigned to Butterfield Hall. However, in my year, the school was undergoing a lack of housing space, so the exchange students were placed in different dorms across campus. Each dorm has a laundry room in the basement (you can use your student ID card or pay with cash), vending machines, a kitchen (usually you would need to bring your own pots/pans), and some common rooms/study rooms. Each floor has a communal bathroom, although depending on what kind of housing you have, you may have access to a more private bathroom shared with a roommate, etc. There is an Undergraduate Advisor (UGA) for each dorm, who is basically your residential advisor and is usually friendly and accessible if you have any questions/problems with your residence.*advice from personal experience:Make sure you always lock your door at night.There are also special dorm communities in the newer, nicer dorm buildings such as ""Living and Learning Communities"" that students must apply beforehand to get in. Although I was unaware of this initially and never ended up applying, from what I have seen and heard, I would recommend it- they are great opportunities to meet students of diverse backgrounds. Also, there are special ""language"" community housing for students who are interested in a particular language/culture, such as the Chinese language house, German language house, etc, which also requires applying beforehand. As for dining/food, Dartmouth uses a prepaid meal plan system. You can buy food in two forms- Meal swipes or DBA(which is basically prepaid dining cash). At the beginning of each term, you can choose what meal plan you want- SmartChoice meal plans give you 5 meal swipes per week, 7 meal swipes per week, 10 meal swipes per week, etc. I personally used the SmartChoice 7, with 7 meal swipes per week. These meal swipes expire at the end of each week and are renewed at the beginning of each week. There are four time blocks each day that you can use your meal swipes- breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night, and you can only use one meal swipe per time block. Depending on which meal plan you are on, you also have a set amount of DBA, or dining cash, which you can use like cash to either buy meals (if you are out of meal swipes for the week), snacks, coffee at the cafe in the library, etc.There are several locations to access food: 1) 53 Commons Building, also known as ""FoCo""- this is the main cafeteria on campus, which is an all-you-can-eat buffet. There are a wide array of food, such as do-it-yourself stir-fry corner, a salad bar, a ""world cuisine"" corner (sometimes they serve sushi for finals period!), a gluten-free corner, a vegetarian corner, and, of course, a dessert corner (famous for its amazing cookies).2) Collis (the student center) cafeteria- known for its customized fruit smoothies, weekly made-on-the-spot sushi, stir-fry and pasta, which can be customized with sauces and ingredients of your choice upon request.3) The Courtyard Cafe at the HOP (the arts center)- known for its grill section, where you can get burgers, enchiladas, quesadillas, and lots more, fresh off the grill. There is also a sandwich/wrap counter that offers a delicious taco salad (which is my personal favorite). 4) Novack Cafe- food cafe located in the back building of the library where you can get snacks and food while taking a study break. During midterms/finals week, it's open 24/7.5) King Arthur Flour (KAF)- popular cafe and bakery located in the front of the library where you can get delicious baked goods/bread/coffee (the line usually tends to be long). This is the only place you can't use your meal swipes, DBA (dining cash) only.If you want to eat off-campus, some of the main restaurants are: Lou's Bakery (breakfast/brunch), Sushiya (Korean cuisine), Jewel of India (Indian), The Orient (Chinese), Basecamp cafe (Nepalese), Bolocco (burritos), and pizza (EBA's). Food off-campus tends to be on the pricey side ($10+ per meal). If you decide to eat out, don't forget to include the tip (10%~15%)!*also, if you decide to stay on campus over interim periods between terms (winter break, spring break, etc.), you might want to check out the Dartmouth Coop, which is a local grocery store about a ten minute walk from campus, where you can buy ingredients to cook your own food.","Dartmouth is an academically rigorous environment. The school terms are much shorter (10 weeks) than regular semesters, so things progress quickly starting from the first week. Students normally take 3 courses (sometimes 4) a term, and the course-registration is more like a lottery system. If you don't get the course you want, however, it is a good idea to email the professor beforehand and they will usually let you in or put you on the waiting list. There is a course add-  period for the first two weeks of the term, during which you can ""shop"" for classes. It is best to set your schedule as soon as possible though so that you do not fall behind, given the fast pace of the term. The courselist for which classes will be open during which term can be easily found on the Dartmouth website, which is helpful for looking ahead of time to see which courses you would be interested in taking.The courses I took during my year include Global Literary Theory, 6 Victorian Novels of Children's Literature, Educational Psychology (fall term), Learning and Education Across Cultures, Colonial Photography, Masterpieces of African Literature (winter term), The Reading Brain, The Learning Brain, Narrative Journalism (spring term). I also took a Beginner's Squash class and a year-long course called Individual Instruction Program (IIP) in the music department, which allowed me to receive 1:1 private instrument lessons and opened opportunities to perform with other students at the end of each term.Dartmouth also has intense but effective language learning courses, which come with language drill sessions every day. If you want to pick up a language, it is a great opportunity:)! Overall, Dartmouth students are very engaged and interested in the fields that they study and are very hard-working. Although it may differ depending on the department/professor/size of the class, students are very active in voicing their thoughts during discussions and asking questions during lectures. From my experience, the professors are also a great resource, and students will often and regularly go in during office hours/by appointment to talk with their professors and ask questions. The professors I have had were very open, caring, and interested towards their students and were always happy to engage in 1:1 conversations and give advice during office hours. There is also a great program that students can request a coupon to ""take your professor out for lunch"" at the Pine (the fancy restaurant at Hanover Inn) once a term, which is funded by Dartmouth Student Affairs.There are a lot of great research and study resources available in Dartmouth's Baker-Berry Library. One particular resource is RWIT (Institute for Writing and Rhetoric), which is a free service that students can use to receive guidance and help in writing or proofreading papers, brainstorming ideas for papers, formatting papers, etc. by fellow Dartmouth students/upperclassmen who have a lot of experience.The library also has a system called BorrowDirect, which you can use to request and access books from not only Dartmouth's library, but the libraries of several other Ivy League campuses. You can request books and textbooks online, and they will arrive in around two days. The loan period is several weeks long, so you can even borrow textbooks for your classes for the term, which is a great way to save money.There is also a  ing service called Green  in the library and in certain locations across campus, which is not always efficient, but the school gives you about $20 on your student ID card for  ing each term.Some of my favorite study spots:-Sherman Art Library-First Floor Berry (FFB)-Sanborne Library (English library- there is tea time at 4 PM every afternoon!)-Kresge Library (I only went here when I really needed to focus- usually not crowded)-Paddock Library (This is a small music library located at the HOP arts center, also not crowded and cozy place that not that many know about:))-Top of the Hop (great view of the Green with long, tall, arched windows)","Office of Visa and Immigration Service (OVIS)- there office is located off-campus on Main Street.As they take care of all legal/visa issues concerning your stay at Dartmouth, it is a good idea to check with them whenever you are traveling out of the country during breaks or if you decide to get a campus job. If you are traveling outside the US during your period of stay at Dartmouth, you will need to return with the same J1-visa status, etc. *If you are working one or more jobs on campus, you will need some documents from OVIS before you start working for legal purposes. You will also need a social security number, which can only be acquired through a trip to the closest Social Security Office in Concord, NH. OVIS plans a couple trips to Concord for this purpose, so make sure you look out for the announcements and reserve a seat on the bus ride!International Students Affairs- there is a director in charge of international students/exchange students who has regular office hours in the International Students Resource Room in Robinson Hall. You can visit to address any questions, concerns, etc. about your time at Dartmouth.","Even though academic life is time-demanding at Dartmouth, students find time to enjoy and thrive in extracurricular activities as well. There are generally a lot of events and activities that go on campus that you can get involved in. You can watch a musical or movie (sometimes earlier than the official release date) at the HOP, watch a sports match (football, icehockey, etc.), attend a stand-up comedian or spoken word show, watch one of many Dartmouth acapella groups perform, attend a talk by a famous visiting author/artist/scholar, volunteer for cooking at the nearby homeless shelter, etc. There is a student activity fair, job fair, and volunteer fair at the beginning of the fall term through which you can get more information about extracurricular activities.Student Events and Club Activities:There are a wide range of student clubs at Dartmouth, from acapellas to the school newspaper, from the international business club to athletic teams such as the the fencing team and the rowing team, and much more. Personally, I joined the marching band in my fall term. I was also mostly involved with the Christian Union (CU) on campus, which was where I met a lot of great, genuine friends. Some of my fondest memories with CU is going apple-picking in the fall, attending the annual thanksgiving banquet, going to winter conference, and going to Storrs pond for a field day of canoeing and barbeque in the spring, playing glow in the dark capture the flag, etc.Outdoor and Sports Activities:Dartmouth students are very active and enjoy various outdoor activities. Dartmouth provides the perfect environment for this too. Students have free access to the Alumni Gym, which has great facilities, along with a swimming pool, squash courts, etc. and is open from early in the morning to usually around 11 pm during the weekdays. In the summer, fall, and spring, students can rent canoes/kayaks and go out on the beautiful Connecticut river. There is also a pond called Occom near the golf-course on the far north side of the campus, which freezes in the winter- perfect for ice-skating. There are also some beautiful trails (Appalachian Trail, Mink Brook trail) within walking distance from campus. In the winter, there is also a shuttle that takes you to Dartmouth's own skiway, where students can ski/snowboard for a discounted price.","Dartmouth is a school “older than America” and has a lot of unique traditions. Every term, there is a “big weekend”- in the fall, there is Homecoming, where a massive bonfire is built on the middle of the Green, and the freshman run around the fire while the upperclassmen and alumni shout and cheer. In the winter, there is the winter carnival and the pond party, where the whole town comes together to take part in the festivities. A unique tradition is the Polar Bear Plunge, where a 15-foot long hole is drilled into the frozen pond, and students jump into the ice cold water and swim across it. The icy feat wins you a badge and possibly a cold. In the spring, there is Green Key, when music bands come to perform and various events take place throughout the weekend.Dartmouth has its own unique lingo as well. For example, the campus email is referred to as “blitz,” so a “blitz” is interchangeable with the word “email.” The word “face-timing” refers to placing oneself somewhere where they are seen by others to socialize, etc. and a a “self-call” is when during a conversation, one intentionally or unintentionally compliments themselves/shows off an accomplishment, etc.The Greek system is a significant part of the social scene at Dartmouth. Starting from the fall of sophomore year, students will have the choice to “rush” a sorority or fraternity. Sororities and fraternities hold various events and parties and have traditions of their own. There are also societies called senior societies and “secret societies” on campus, which was also a very new concept to me.Another “culture shock” was how students would freely leave their laptops or phones on tables in cafeteria, library, etc. for significant amounts of time without fear of getting them stolen. It is more likely to have your bike or jacket disappear than your phone or laptop, believe it or not. Also, whenever a student loses or leaves their dartID card somewhere, most often another student/staff who finds it will “blitz” (email) you with the name written on your card and return it to you.","Safety and Security (SNS)- SNS is always available on call wherever you are on campus. You can call them if you are locked out of your room, you lose something, etc. Also, when it’s late at night and you don’t feel safe walking all the way across campus alone in the dark, you can ask SNS to drive you to your dorm (called a “safe ride”).UGAs and Undergraduate Deans- Every student has an undergraduate advisor who is in charge of anything related to your residency. Undergraduate deans are also available for appointments, and you can talk to them about any concerns about your academics, classes, etc.","Other helpful info:Sustainability Sale- at the beginning of the Fall term, there is a sustainability sale in which second-hand living items/dorm furniture such as mini-refridgerators, bikes, desk lamps, school supplies, water filters, shelves, heaters, etc. are sold at cheap prices. At the end of the year, you can donate them back.DASH- Dartmouth uses a DASH system, which is basically money stored and charged in your student ID card. Whenever you do your laundry, buy a ticket at the HOP, buy food at a fund raising event, or buy something from Collis Market at the student center, etc. you can choose to either pay with cash or with your DASH account, which is pre-paid.Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding life at Dartmouth at ej0806@gmail.comHave fun!"
"다트머스 대학교는 매해 약 1400명의 학생들이 입학하기 때문에 학생 수는 연세대학교보다 훨씬 적습니다(3분의 1이라고 보면 됩니다). 메인 캠퍼스 자체는 269에이커이고 주변의 산림지대는 2만 에이커가 넘습니다.지리적으로 북동부 뉴햄프셔 주의 해노버에 위치해 있기 때문에 늦여름부터 서늘하며 초가을 부터 초여름까지 춥고, 특히 11월말부터 3월까지는 매우 추운 날씨에 눈도 많이 내립니다(바람은 대도시에 비해 덜한 편입니다).","다트머스는 연세대학교와 달리 도시가 아닌 산림지대에 위치해 있기 때문에 주변에 산과 강(Connecticut River)이 많습니다. 그래서 가을학기 전 입학생 및 교환학생을 위한 캠프인 DOC Trip도 Hiking, Cabin Camping, Canoeing, Nature Photography 등과 같은 프로그램으로 이루어져 있습니다.학교 입구 바로 앞의  Main Street에는 J-crew, 브런치 가게, 디저트 가게, 수제 햄버거나 파스타를 파는 패밀리 레스토랑, 한식/일식/태국식/인도식 레스토랑, 악세사리 가게, 문구점, 슈퍼마켓 등이 있어 금요일 저녁이나 주말에는 캠퍼스 밖에서 식사를 하거나 쉬는 학생들이 많습니다.마을버스를 15분 내외로 타고 해노버 밖으로 나가면, West Lebanon 지역으로 갈 수 있는데, 이 곳에서는 월마트를 포함한 여러가지 대형 쇼핑몰이 있고, 핸드폰을 구입하거나 유심칩을 구입하여 미국 핸드폰번호를 만들 수 있는 Verizon과 AT&T가 있습니다.","거의 모든 학생들이 캠퍼스 내 기숙사에 거주하며 특히 교환학생들은 한 기숙사에서 같이 살게끔 학교에서 배정해주기도 합니다. 저는 Butterfield라는 기숙사에 1년(세 쿼터) 동안 머물렀습니다. 식사는 거의 학식을 먹습니다. 학기를 등록할 때 함께 등록한 meal plan으로 Foco(뷔페식), HOP(햄버거, 고기요리, 샌드위치), Collis(볶음밥, 오믈렛, 파스타), 그리고 교내 카페에서 다양한 식사를 할 수 있습니다.","다트머스 수업에서 가장 인상적이었던 부분은 열띤 토론이 일상화된 학생들의 모습이었습니다. 교수님과 학생들이 함께 수업을 이끌어나가면서 교수님뿐만 아니라 학생들에게서도 배울 수 있는 점이 많았습니다. Liberal Arts가 강한 학교인 만큼, 논문, 기사, 책을 포함은 읽기 자료의 양이 매우 많고 그것을 바탕으로 매번 수업이 진행되었습니다.각 대학원의 도서관이나 캠퍼스 내 다양한 곳곳에 학생들이 공부할 수 있는 공간이 있지만, 아무래도 학생들이 가장 많이 공부하는 곳은 중앙도서관인 Baker Berry Library였습니다. 이 도서관에는 공부할 수 있는 곳, 책을 읽거나 빌릴 수 있는 곳, 미디어 서비스를 이용할 수 있는 곳, 조모임을 하거나 토론할 수 있는 곳, 학생들의 글을 첨삭해주는 곳 등이 있습니다.","다트머스에는 교환학생을 포함한 국제학생들을 위한 서비스를 제공하는 기관이 따로 있습니다. 비자 관련 문제, 응급상황 대처 요령, 수강신청 요령, 교내 IT 서비스 등과 관련된 오리엔테이션을 주관하고 궁금한 점이 있을 때마다 문의할 수 있어 국제 교환학생의 입장에서 매우 편리했습니다.","학교 메일 시스템을 통해 학교에 관한 유용한 정보를 받아볼 수 있고, 학교에서 열리는 콘서트, 세미나, 컨퍼런스, 토론회, 댄스 퍼포먼스 등과 같은 행사가 많아 관심 있는 분야가 있다면 그 분야의 동아리나 단체에 가입하여 다른 학생들과 교류하며 활동할 수 있습니다.",우리나라 대학에는 없고 미국 영화나 드라마에서나 볼 수 있었던 Fraternity와 Sorority 문화가 아무래도 가장 신기했습니다. 테마를 정하여 파티를 열 때도 있지만 주로 beer pong이라는 게임을 합니다. 평일 밤에는 조용하지만 금요일이나 토요일 밤에는 학생들이 이 곳에서 스트레스를 푸는 것 같았습니다.,"Safety and Security(SNS)나 Trouble Shooter 번호를 미리 저장해 두어, 응급상황이 발생했을 때 바로 전화를 걸 수 있었습니다.","학업적으로 교수님이나 학생들이 수업에 참여하는 태도와 공부를 하는 자세에서 많은 것을 배울 수 있었고, 다양한 배경을 가진 사람들을 만나면서 스스로 많이 성장할 수 있는 소중한 시간이었습니다. 연세대학교 교환학생 프로그램을 통해 이러한 경험을 할 수 있다는 것에 감사했습니다."
"다트머스대학교는 학부 티칭 중심 대학교로, 우리 학교보다 훨씬 적은 학생수로 이루어져 있습니다. 다트머스가 위치한 해노버도 매우 작습니다. 차를 타고 조금만 위로 올라가면 해노버를 벗어나 뉴햄프셔주 내의 다른 도시들로 이를 수 있고 다리를 건너면 옆주인 버몬트주로 도착하게 됩니다. 9월초부터 벌써 긴팔을 입을 만큼 선선한 날씨였고 1월초부터는 폭설이 내리고 기온이 크게 떨어져 4월까지도 눈이 왔습니다. 혹독한 겨울 날씨를 견디기 위해 겨울학기 동안 학생들은 부츠나 보온이 된 겨울신발을 신고 두꺼운 겨울외투와 그 안에 플리스를 입는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.","다트머스대학교가 위치한 해노버는 서울이나 보스턴과 같은 대도시가 아니라 시골이기 때문에 우리 학교 주변 신촌 상권과는 다른 분위기입니다. 백화점이나 대형쇼핑몰은 없지만 당장 학생들이 생활에 필요한 것은 갖추고 있습니다. 학교 바로 앞 Main Street에 옷가게, 한식 식당, 서점/화장품, 문구점, 24시간 운영되는 대형슈퍼/약국, 영화관 등이 있습니다. 과일, 채소, 치즈 등 신선식품을 구입하려면 Advance Transit이라는 무료 버스를 캠퍼스 내에서 타거나 자가용으로 Dartmouth Co-Op으로 가야합니다. Advance Transit을 15분~20분 가량 타고 West Lebanon이라는 인근 지역으로 가면 이불이나 공구를 파는 대형쇼핑몰들과 통신사 대리점들이 있습니다.","대부분의 학생들은 기숙사에 살고 기숙사에 사는 학생들은 밀 플랜을 신청해 한꺼번에 지불한 금액에서 차감하며 식당들에서 식사를 하고 매점과 교내 커피숍에서 소비하는 것이 원칙입니다. 일부 정규학생들은 학교 앞 아파트에 마음 맞는 친구들끼리 살기도 하지만 교환학생들은 기숙사에 사는 것이 원칙입니다. 국제교환학생들은 Butterfield Hall에 모여 사는데 저는 첫학기만 Butterfield Hall에서 살고 나머지 두학기는 독일어와 독일에 관심이 있는 학생들이 모여 독일어를 사용하며 거주하는 독일 아파트에서 살았습니다. 식사는 원하는 학교 식당에서 밀플랜으로 해결할 수 있고, 원한다면 Butterfield Hall 1층 공용 부엌이나 제가 살던 독일 아파트와 같은 일부 기숙사 내의 개인 부엌에서 요리해 먹을 수 있습니다.","연세대 언더우드국제대학의 수업도 활발한 토론을 바탕으로 진행되는데도 다트머스대학교 수업들의 열띤 토론 분위기와 학생들의 수업 주도식의 적극적인 참여에 자극을 받았습니다. 매일 많은 양의 읽을거리를 받고 많이 읽고 생각하고 쓰면서 수업을 준비하고, 수업에서는 학생들과 많이 말하고 많이 들으며 공부하게 됩니다. 수업 전 읽으면서 자신이 이해한 지점까지 지식을 나누고, 이해하지 못한 부분부터는 다른 토론자로부터 배우고 함께 지식과 사고의 결과물을 공유하고 쌓아올리며 더 깊이 공부할 수 있습니다. 학교 내에서 수업 준비를 하고 공부하고, 수업 후 밥을 먹고 도서관이나 자신만의 공부 장소로 바로 복귀하여 공부하며 공부와 생활이 자연스레 일체형이 되는 다트머스에는 다양한 공부 장소가 있습니다. 중앙도서관 격인 Baker Berry Library부터 영문과 도서관인 Sanborn House, 공과대학-경영대학 도서관인 Feldberg Library, 음악대학 도서관 등 장서 종류에 따라 여러 도서관이 있습니다. Baker Berry 1층과 Feldberg Library에는 인쇄기, 복사기, 스캐너가 갖추어져 있습니다. 저는 주로 Sanborn House, Baker Berry의 Stack, 그리고 제 아파트에서 가까운 Feldberg Library에서 공부를 하였는데 학생들마다 Baker Berry Library Tower Room, Berry 1, Baker Berry 내 커피숍인 KAF, 학교식당 FOCO 2층, 학교식당 Collis 등 다양한 공부장소에서 공부합니다.","다트머스대학교에는 국제 '교환'학생의 수가 30명에 못미칠 정도로 적었던 것으로 기억합니다. 국제 '교환'학생만을 위한 부서라기 보다는 학교 전체 국제학생들을 위한 Office of Pluralism and Leadership (OPAL)이 있고 훌륭한 직원 선생님과 좋은 프로그램들이 갖추어져 있습니다. 가을학기 시작 전 국제 정규 신입생들을 위한 international student orientation에 참여하여 국제학생들에게 필요한 정보들 (은행, 휴대폰, 비자 등)을 얻을 수 있고 국제 학생 친구들을 사귈 수 있습니다. 평소에도 국제 학생들을 위한 오피스 아워가 마련되어 있습니다. 저는 특히 이 부서에서 주관하는 프로그램 중 Upper Valley의 미국인 가족과 다트머스의 국제학생을 연결해주는 international friendship family 프로그램을 통하여 저의 미국인 가족과 좋은 인연을 맺을 수 있었습니다. 이외에도 언어교환 프로그램, 국제 학생 겨울 축제 등 다양한 행사가 열립니다.","학교 앞 HOP (Hopkins Center for the Arts)에서 열리는 음악회, 미술 전시회, 뮤지컬, 영화 상영 행사 등을 다트머스 학생으로서 저렴한 가격으로 즐길 수 있습니다. 학교 블리츠(Blitz)이메일 시스템으로 오는 각종 교내 단체와 동아리 홍보 이메일을 보고 마음에 맞는 행사에 참여하여 동아리에 가입할 수 있습니다.","메뉴마다 개인의 선택의 폭이 넓은 것이 인상적이었습니다. 커피에 넣는 우유 조차 skim, 2%, 1%, soy 중 선택할 수 있고 식당 마다 vegetarian, vegan, gluten free의 메뉴가 잘 갖추어져 있었습니다. 또한 한국보다 인종의 문제에 더 민감하고 인종에 관한 논의가 더 활발하고 심각하게 이루어지는 것을 볼 수 있었습니다.","의사의 진료가 필요할 때는 학교 내 보건센터인 Dick's House에 진료 예약을 하거나 응급 상황일 때는 Safety and Security (SNS)에 전화를 걸어 바로 찾아가 진료를 받을 수 있습니다. 수강신청, 학업, 커리어 등에 대해 교수님들 또는 학생마다 배정받는 Undergraduate Dean께 여쭈어볼 수 있습니다.",다트머스대학교에서 학업면에서나 인생살이 측면에서나 많이 배우고 성장할 수 있었습니다. 엄청난 공부량을 소화하고 다양한 사람들과 어울려 살아가는 다트머스대학교 생활을 적극적으로 하면서 값진 경험을 쌓을 수 있을 것입니다.
"Dartmouth College is a small liberal-arts based college located in Hanover, New Hampshire. The town of Hanover sits right on the border between the state of New Hampshire and Vermont. Dartmouth College is a lot smaller in size compared to Yonsei, with about 4,000 undergraduate students. New England weather is quite cold for the most part, but the dorms are heated well with radiators. The campus is especially beautiful in the fall when the weather is still warm and the leaves are turning colorful. It’s especially great weather for canoeing on the Connecticut River, which cuts through the campus. Moreover, there is lots of snow in the winter, and winter activities are widely available in and around Dartmouth College.","Hanover , New Hampshire is a very small town, with about 11,000 residents. CNN and Money magazine rated Hanover the sixth best place to live in America in 2011. It’s a very safe town, with low crime rates. Hanover is also very small. The town only extends a few blocks off-campus. Although it is a small town, you’ll find that it has all the essentials what you need. There are Korean/Japanese, American, Indian, Chinese, Italian, Thai, Mexican restaurants. There is a Subway, a Starbucks, and a bubble tea shop. The town has a post office, movie theatre, and several banks also. Hanover also has a CVS (an American drugstore similar to Olive Young in Korea), where you can get pretty much all the basic things you need. There are a couple brand clothing shops, such as J Crew and Talbots, as well as places that sell Dartmouth school attire. If you take a free bus called the “Advance Transit” into the nearby town (which is bigger than Hanover) called West Lebannon, there are places like Wal-Mart, K-Mart, T.J. Maxx, etc where you can see a largerr variety of what you’re looking for. Also, buying things on the internet is also a good way to get things you need.","Dartmouth College is a residential college, meaning that just about everybody lives on campus (even those who are “off-campus” are literally minutes away from the college, since Hanover is so small). Exchange students are usually placed in Butterfield Hall, an old dorm built in the 30’s and located in the center of the campus, or in the McLaughlin cluster dorms, which is a newer dorm placed around the back of the campus. Dorms usually have a shared bathroom on each floor, and are maintained daily by Dartmouth’s custodial staff. Butterfield is located at the center of campus, so it makes going around campus more convenient, but it is a bit loud at night, since many students pass by outside. McLaughlin dorms are usually quieter and have newer facilities, but are relatively far away from the main part of the campus. However, since the college itself is not that big to start with, the walks are in no way unbearable.

Every student at Dartmouth is required to be on a campus dining plan. You can choose from different dining plan types and change it during the first week of each quarter depending on your needs. There are several dining options on campus. The main dining facility is called the “1953 Commons” or “Foco” which is short for food court. It is a buffet-style, all-you-can-eat dining place which has a diversity of food such as vegetables, meats, soups, desserts, specialties, and so on. There are other dining facilities such as the Collis Cafe located right across from Foco, as well as the Hop Cafe located in the Hopkin’s Center for the Arts. The Novack Cafe and King Arthur’s Flour Cafe (KAF) are located in the main Baker-Berry library.","Unlike most universities, Dartmouth’s academic calendar runs on a “quarter system” which means there are 4 ten-week-long terms a year. The term passes by relatively quickly, with usually two midterms and one final for a standard course. Students usually take 3 courses per term. Although it depends on the course, class sizes in general are small. Introductory classes usually have about 50 or more students, mid-level classes have about 20-30 students, while intensive seminar classes usually have about 5-10 people. In general, most Dartmouth students participate actively in class discussions, regardless of size. Also, Dartmouth professors are very responsive to their students and hold open office hours where students can freely visit their professors to talk with them. Office hours are good opportunities for you to get to know your professor and for your professor to learn about you.

Dartmouth offers a wide variety of courses for its undergraduate students in different departments. It offers a lot of fresh courses that you might not encounter at Yonsei, so I suggest that you look carefully through the course listings and pick what interests you the most. Similar to Yonsei, Dartmouth has a course “add-and-drop” period at the beginning of the term, so you can sit in multiple classes during the first week and choose what you want to take. Classes, especially those in the social sciences and liberal arts, involve a lot of reading, writing, and discussion in class. In my case, I took courses mostly in the English and Government department, as well as a few classes from the Psychology department (Some classes I took: 20th C. American Fiction, Narrative Journalism, Politics of Asia, International Conflict and Cooperation, International Institutions, International Relations, Abnormal Psychology, and Developmental Psychology).

There are also several libraries on-campus. The main library is called Baker-Berry and is located at the center of the campus. This is where most students study and get their books. Dartmouth is part of an inter-library loan system called “Borrow-Direct” where you can request books from the libraries of all the Ivy-League schools + MIT. Therefore, it’s possible to get just about any book you’re looking for through the “Borrow-Direct” system. In my case, I was able to get some of the books needed for my classes through the library instead of buying them. On the second floor of the Baker-Berry library is also the “Jones Media Center” where students can edit/create videos, borrow filming/recording equipment, and work on media projects. You can also borrow DVDs for free from the Jones Media Center.","There is no separate body that oversees international exchange students. However, there is an Office of Visa and Immigration (OVIS) which helps out international students with their inquiries. Since international exchange students are considered as “international students,” it’s best to seek help from there when you have particular inquiries. They are available via appointment, email, or phone. Also, there is a group called “Transfer and Exchange Club” (TREX), which is composed of previous and recent transfer students and exchange students at Dartmouth, who can provide assistance. Also, basic questions can probably be answered by your Undergraduate Advisor (UGA), who is a Dartmouth upperclassman that lives in your dorm and oversees his/her residents.","There are many things aside from just academics available at Dartmouth. There are several different student clubs at Dartmouth from music-related organizations to religious, cultural, volunteering, and academic organization. Many Dartmouth students are involved in such extracurricular activities, so it’s a good way to meet new friends and further develop your area of interest.

There also many opportunities to work on campus. The J-1 visa status given to exchange students permits you to work as long as it is on-campus. There is a job fair held at the beginning of each term as well as website that shows which jobs are available. It’s a good way to make pocket money and gain working experience.

There is also a gym on campus that has excellent facilities. Also, the campus is generally good for taking a walk or exercising outside. There are even P.E. courses that students can take for credit.","Dartmouth is famous for its Greek system, which is a big part of the social scene at Dartmouth. “Fraternities” host open parties almost every weekend, so it won’t be too difficult to get a taste of Greek life at Dartmouth. Fraternities and Sororities will host “formals” which are similar to a “prom” where students dress up and bring their dates. Formals are usually held in cabins and scenic places around Hanover. A lot of American students play “beer pong” which is a ping pong game played with cups of beer. Dartmouth is famous for its “paddle pong” meaning that you try to get the ball into the other team’s cups of beer using a paddle. Many students at Dartmouth enjoy this game, and it’s a big social game at Dartmouth.

Also, most dorms in Dartmouth are not gender-specific, meaning that males and females will live together on the same floor. There are no entrance restrictions or anything like that for entering in and out of dorms, and it’s a very communal living atmosphere in general.","It’s very easy to get help for any problem you have at Dartmouth. Just inquire and it will be solved. If there is a problem with the room, you can call the custodian. If your student card doesn’t work, you can go to the Card office. If you encounter problems with paying tuition, you can go to the Finance office. If you’re sick, you can go to the Dick’s House, the Student Health Service Center. If you want to practice your instrument, you can go to the Hopkin’s Center for the Arts and use the practice rooms there. If you have problems with the internet or your computer, there is a computing services office in the library with students who can assist you. As mentioned before, professors are available for academic advice and help. There is a writing center at the library if you need help with writing a paper. E-mail is especially a good method of communication for most people are always checking their on-campus emails frequently every day.","Dartmouth really widens your perspective because you get to meet so many new people and gain experience that you might not have had otherwise in Korea. Make the best of your time at Dartmouth. Study hard, and have fun, like most Dartmouth students do!"
"Dartmouth College is a small liberal-arts based college located in Hanover, New Hampshire, the state left to Maine and right below the Canadian border. There are approximately 4000 undergraduate students. Because it is located in the north, the winters are long (snowing from November until April). Be prepared to face cold, harsh, yet beautiful New England winters! Though New England autumns are beautiful, they are unfortunately also very short, so take as many pictures as you can when it is still sunny and clear outside! It is also very dry during winters, and since the heaters are radiators, it would be a good idea to obtain a humidifier, or if you can''t, remember to bring lots of skin moisturizers.","Hanover , New Hampshire is a small town of approximately 11,000 people. It was ranked the 2nd best place to live in the United States in 2007 by Money Magazine. It is a town of mostly old, retired, Caucasian Americans. The town itself is only a few blocks. Though it is a small town there is one of everything. One movie theater, Korean/Japanese restaurant, Indian restaurant, Chinese restaurant, Thai restaurant, bank (Bank of America), Mexican fast food, Starbucks, etc, so don''t expect much diversity. There are few clothing shops, and most of the shops are catered to older customers or relatively expensive (J.Crew, Talbots, Dartmouth Coop University store, North Face). The nearest clothing stores are about an hour away via bus, so it is a good idea to pack some basic and reliable items such as outerwear (parkas, hats, gloves). It is also a good idea to bring a good pair of boots, because it is very cold and boots are the best way to walk around campus. Don''t forget to bring basic items such as shirts, pants, underwear, because they are hard to obtain in Hanover.","Foco, short for food court, is the main dining facility on campus. It is a buffet-style, all you can eat dining hall. There are also other dining facilities such as Collis Cafe in front of Foco, the HOP, located in the Hopkins Center for Performing Arts, and Novack Cafe, a snack bar in the library. 

It is also a residential college, so almost all students live on campus. Exchange students are usually placed in Butterfield Hall, an old dorm in the center of Campus, located next to Russell Sage Hall, and behind Fahey McLane, dorms usually reserved for freshmen students. They are also placed in McLaughlin Cluster, a newer dorm facility located in the rear of the campus. I stayed in Butterfield Hall, and though the facilities were a bit old, the central location makes it great for getting around campus in just a few minutes. In the winter, since it is relatively close to the cafeterias, walks outside were less painful.","&#61591;	Quarter system: 4 semesters a year
&#61591;	3 subjects per term: but tough workload
&#61591;	Reading, writing, and especially, discussion intensive !
&#61591;	Some of the courses I took: 
  (Creative Writing Fiction, Japanese, Spanish, International Relations, Asian Politics, Turkish-German film) 
One of the best things about going to the US for exchange, for me, was the numerous classes I could take. If I were to go to Europe, I don’t think there would have been as many courses offered in English, because a lot of the courses would be offered in the native language, and because the students wouldn’t have been as proficient in english, which would not have helped in improving my English proficiency.
Something more important that I learned academically was the importance of knowing how to voice your opinions in class discussions. Though UIC classes have more discussions than other classes taught in Korean at Yonsei, I was very surprised at the level of discussion and debate that led the classes at Dartmouth, no matter how small or big the classes were. 
Also, I learned how important UIC CC courses were for college academics. Had I not taken Writing tutorial, history, or even research methods, I don’t think I would have had a foundation to build upon. The CC courses at UIC are very similar to the freshmen requirements at Dartmouth, and I think doing well at UIC really prepares you for anywhere you go.","There is no separate international office for students, because there are fewer than 20 international exchange students every year. When I was at the College, there were 17 international exchange students from Seoul, Copenhagen, Japan, Germany, Italy, and Thailand. We are considered international students, and requested to attend the international freshman orientation instead of the regular freshman orientation for American students. However, we are also grouped together with the domestic transfer/exchange students, students that have transferred from other universities in the States, and students from other universities that are currently pursuing dual degrees in Dartmouth Thayer Engineering School. In Butterfield Hall, a fellow Yonsei student and Japanese exchange students lived with the dual degree students. They are placed under the guidance under the same advisor/dean.","Since I was an exchange student, there was less pressure to get good grades, since you only have to get over a C to pass, and that grade does not carry back to Yonsei, only the credit. Thus you have more opportunities to be involved in more things around campus, such as clubs, or on-campus jobs. I was surprised at the types of clubs at Dartmouth, and how many students were involved. There are acapella clubs, cultural affiliation clubs (Asian, Latino organizations), music clubs, newspapers, academic journals, intramural sports, volunteer clubs, etc. 

There also many opportunities to work on campus, even for exchange students on J1 visa. Pay ranges from 8-12 dollars an hour, and it is a great way to get work experience and make some pocket money (though you won''t be spending that much money because all your meals are purchased by a prepaid meal plan by swiping your student ID.) There is a separate site for finding part-time jobs on campus, and most of these jobs recruit at the start of the term. Jobs range from washing dishes/making baked goods/being a cashier at the dining halls, working at the alumni call center, working at library circulation desks, administrative assistant work at various offices, etc.","The Greek system is an integral part of Dartmouth social life. Unlike clubs in Korea, school clubs are not the strongest social forces that forms groups on campus. Fraternities and Sororities are important to Dartmouth students. In the beginning of fall and winter term, students, usually sophomores, ""rush,"" which means they go around different fraternities (boys) and sororities (girls), meet their upperclassmen brothers and sisters there, try to make friends with them and impress them if you want to join that specific house, and after you are accepted, go through a ""pledge"" process which is the initiation period, when you are asked to do various tasks for the members of the house, executing tasks testing your loyalty and willingness to be a part of that group. On Fridays, various fraternities hold dance parties and beer pong games in their basements. Unlike Korea, where alcohol games require much concentration and brainpower, Dartmouth students play beer pong, where students try to ""sink"" a ping pong ball into the other team''s cup. Every time the ball touches or sinks into the other team''s cup, the other team much drink that cup filled with beer, and whoever is left with the most cups wins. Being asked to play beer pong is also equivalent to being asked to a date. Every term, each fraternity and sorority has its own ''formal,'' which is, as the name suggest, formal parties where each member brings a date to a dinner and a dance outside to a location outside of campus. Though not all students decide to join the Greek system, many students find it as a great way to make friends, network for careers, and meet alumni. 

I was shocked by the level of sexual and cultural openness that pervaded the campus. Unlike Korean universities, it easy to meet and befriend homosexual students, students from Ghana to Ecuador, and especially in fraternity basements, it is easy to see students being openly physical, and though sometimes it may lead to unwanted interaction, many students try to relieve their stress by meeting with friends in such social spaces.

I was also surprised by the level of physical health that students try to maintain. It is easy to see joggers everywhere, and in sportswear, unlike Korea, where students run mostly run out of necessity because they are late for class, and in case of girls, in their high heels. At Dartmouth, though many students favor preppy clothing, yoga wear and jogging clothes are also enjoyed by female students. Students do not worry about their appearance as much, in terms of cosmetics and fashion, in some part due to the freezing winters that make it impossible for you to recognize each other anyway, because everyone is so bundled up, and in part due to the fact you practically share your entire day with fellow students, and thus have less incentive to wear uncomfortable clothes. Wearing heels actually makes you stand out at Dartmouth.","Dartmouth is very efficient. If you have a problem with your room, you can ask your building''s custodian for help. If you need help with the printer or computer, there is a computing services office in the Berry library with students assistants. If you need help with academic work, there are free tutoring programs you can apply for certain classes. If you need help with things related to your visa or immigration documents, contact the OVIS office (Office of visa and immigration services). Because the entire campus uses the campus email system (called the ""Blitz"" system, a Microsoft Outlook-based email system), everyone is very responsive. 

The Borrow Direct system, an inter-library loaning system enables students to borrow books from all the other Ivy Leagues + MIT. If a book doesn''t exist at Dartmouth, students can request the book online, and the book is shipped to Dartmouth in 3 days for free. 

If you are sick, you can visit Dick''s House. Since it is not a hospital, if there are serious injuries/xrays involved, you may be placed in the bigger hospital in town. There are also vending machines inside Dicks House that sell basic cold medicines and contraception tools. Though Dicks House treatment is free, once you are moved to a medical facility outside of campus, there may be additional expenses involved.","Dartmouth is a school with students that are very proud of the school. You will occasionally come across students who are the second, or even third generation from their family to be attending the institution. Many alumni come back for homecoming, and are famous for donating much to the school and for recruiting ""hubaes."" There are many opportunities to see how much students love the school, such as Homecoming, Winter Carnival, and Green Key (spring festival). It is also interesting to see students dressed and even painted in green when they root for their home team during major games such as the traditional Harvard-Dartmouth football game and Princeton-Dartmouth Ice Hockey game. It is a great way to be immersed in American college life, and to feel a part of the community."
"일단, 다트머스의 기후는 미국의 북동부쪽에 위치해 있기 때문에 가을에는 한국보다 쌀쌀하고 겨울은 굉장히 춥다. 가을에는 저녁이 되면 따뜻한 겉옷이 필요하고 겨울에는 보통 스키복과 같은 두터운 외투와 스노우부츠를 신고 다닌다. 봄과 여름은 날씨가 매우 좋다. 하지만, 가을과 겨울이 굉장히 길고 짧은 봄을 지내고 여름이 다가올때쯤 교환학생 생활이 끝나버린다. 또한, 눈과 비가 많이 오므로 방수가 되는 외투가 한벌쯤 있으면 유용하게 입을 수 있다. 
학교 캠퍼스는 타 미국 대학보다 크지 않은 편으로 수업 건물에서 건물간 또는 기숙사에서 수업 건물까지 10분내에 이동할수 있다. 하지만, 학교가 소유하고 있는 골프 코스라던가, 호수 등 주위의 자연을 합한다면 면적이 꽤 넓다고 할수도 있겠다. 지리적 위치로는, 보스턴보다는 몬트리올에 더 가까이 위치해 있을만큼 근처에 대도시가 없고 middle of nowhere에 있다고들 한다. 하지만 보스턴까지는 다트머스 코치라는 버스를 타고 2시간 30분, 뉴욕까지는 4시간 정도가 걸린다.","거의 다트머스 하나로 주위의 상권이 유지된다고 볼 수 있다. 학교 앞으로 두 블록정도 상권이 있는데 제일 끝에 주유소와 CVS를 끝으로 숲이 시작된다. 학교 앞에는 4개 정도의 까페, 10개 정도의 레스토랑, 3개의 옷집, 2군데의 pub, Bank of America, 우체국 등이 있다.","모든 학생들이 학교 기숙사에 삽니다. 제가 있었던 곳은 McLaughlin cluster 였고 여러 클러스터가 캠퍼스에 고루 퍼져있습니다. 기숙사는 싱글룸에 혼자 살거나 투룸 더블에서 룸메이트와 함께 살수 있습니다. 보통 교환학생은 투룸 더블에 넣어줍니다. 방에는 에어컨이나 히터가 없습니다. 하지만 견딜수 없을정도로 춥거나 덥진 않습니다. 창문을 열어두면 바람이 불고 문을 닫으면 건물내에 따뜻한 기운이 돕니다. 하지만 겨울이 매우 춥기때문에 두껍고 따뜻한 이불이 필요합니다. 
식사를 할수 있는곳은 5곳 정도가 있습니다. 제일 기본적인 53 Comons는 뷔페 형태로 일정한 금액을 내면 다양한 음식을 먹을수 있습니다. Collis cafe에서는 fried rice나 omelette, pasta, smoothie, salad등을 팝니다. Novack cafe는 baker berry library 아래에 있는 작은 까페 겸 스낵바로 간단하게 식사로 때울수 있는 음식을 팝니다. Courtyard cafe는 Hop이라는 건물에 있는 카페테리아로 그릴음식이나 멕시칸 음식을 팝니다. 그외에는 Tuck Business School 건물에 있는 Byrne Hall과 East Wheelock에 작은 스낵바가 있습니다.","수업은 각 학과의 건물에서 진행되고 역시 발표를 많이 유도하고 3,4학년 수업을 듣는다면 seminar 수업이 많습니다. 하나의 특이한 점은 꼭 전공학생들만 해당과의 수업을 듣는것은 아닙니다. 예를 들어, 인문학을 전공하는 학생이 이과대의 수업을 듣고 싶다면 다른 학생들과 똑같이 신청해서 들을수 있습니다. 그래서 저의 경우에는 평소에 관심이 있었던 arts class나 engineering class를 들을수 있었습니다. 
다트머스에는 공부할 공간이 굉장히 많습니다. Main Library인 Baker Berry Library 뿐만 아니라, 고풍스러운 느낌의 Sanborn, 오래된 사료가 많이 전시된 Rauner, 음악 관련된 책인 많은 Paddock 등 공부할 곳이 굉장히 많습니다. 시험기간이나 페이퍼를 쓰는 때마다 도서관을 바꿔가며 공부를 하는 것도 하나의 재미입니다.","국제 교육부는 따로 없는것 같고 International Student Organization이라고 international students가 운영하는 학생클럽이 있습니다. 이곳에서 international 학생들의 오리엔테이션이나 적응을 돕고 있습니다. 또한 많은 이벤트를 주최하므로 다양한 국적의 친구들을 만나서 타국에서 적응하고 살아가는 방법을 공유할수 있습니다. 
더해서 비자관련 오피스(OVIS)에서도 국제 학생들을 관리하므로 비자나 보험관련 문의는 이쪽으로 하면 됩니다.","미국학교 답게 아카펠라 그룹들이 굉장히 많이 있습니다. 그중에서 이번에 미국의 아카펠라 쇼에 참가한  Dartmouth Airs도 다트머스의 대표적인 아카펠라 그룹입니다. 다른 유명 동아리는 댄스 동아리인 Sheeba등이 있습니다. 이러한 유명 동아리는 면접(?)을 보고 들어가게 됩니다. 그외에도 학생들의 관심을 기반으로 한 다양한 동아리들이 많습니다. 가을학기 초에 신입생들을 위해 booth가 서므로 동아리에 관심이 많다면 눈여겨 보면 될것 같습니다. 
또한 다트머스는 greek life가 매우 발달한 대학 중 하나이므로 각 하우스의 sister나 brother가 되고 싶다면 지원 가능 시기를 미리 알아보기를 추천합니다. 또 각 하우스마다 텀 별로 대표적인 파티나 이벤트가 굉장히 많으므로 다 알아보고 참석해보기를 권장합니다.","우선 한국과 매우 다른 것은 모든 음식에 대한 preference를 묻는다는 것입니다. 샌드위치면 ""햄샌드위치""하고 딱 정해져 있는것이 아니라 들어가는 재료중에서 무엇을 더해달라 무엇을 빼달라 상세하게 요구할수 있고 주문하는 사람의 취향에 따라 샌드위치가 나옵니다. subway에서 샌드위치를 먹을때처럼 거의 모든 요리에 대해 나의 preference를 말해야 하는게 굉장히 신선했습니다.
또다른 컬쳐쇼크는 학생들의 공부량이었습니다. 언뜻보면 매일밤 파티를 하러 나가고 비어퐁을 치러 놀러 나가는 것 같지만 낮에 하는 공부량이 굉장히 많습니다. 그만큼 time management가 뛰어나다는 것인것 같습니다. 공부할 것 다하고 과외활동도 활발히 참여하며 놀기도 잘 노는 학생들입니다. 또한, 우리나라와는 달리 쿼터제이므로 한 텀이 매우 빨리 지나갑니다. 잠시 딴생각을 하고 있으면, 한 텀의 반이 지나가있고 어느새 중간고사가 다가옵니다. 우리가 4개월에 배우는 것을 10주 안에 다 배우려 하기때문에 한번 수업을 빠지면 받는 타격도 꽤 큽니다. 한 텀에 수업을 세개 듣는게 기본이기 때문에 한국에 비교해서 덜 듣고 널널한 느낌이지만 학기가 시작하면 그런 생각이 사라질 것입니다.","건강이 좋지 않다면 Dick''s House에서 도움을 받을 수 있고 안전에 위협을 느낀다면 SNS에 연락을 하면 됩니다. 또한, 수업을 고르는데 있어 고민이 된다면 학기 초에 배정받는 undergraduate dean을 찾아가면 됩니다. 기본적인 학교 생활이나 기숙사 생활에 고민이 있다면 각 floor의 책임자를 찾으면 도움을 얻을수 있습니다.",jiyoung.ahn511@gmail.com
"Dartmouth College is located in a small town of Hanover, NH, which is on the northeastern part of the States. Hanover is a typical suburban area with a small population and peaceful environment--the saying goes that New Hampshire is the safest state in the US, and Hanover is the safest city in New Hampshire. The nearest ""big"" city from Hanover is Boston, which is two and a half hours away by bus.
The campus size is similar to Yonsei, if not a bit smaller, but the number of undergraduate students is about 4,000--compared to Yonsei, you would definitely have more space to enjoy. The climate of Hanover is pretty similar to that of Seoul, except that it can gets much colder on the coldest days of winter. With lots of snow and a school skiway located within 30 minutes by bus, winter at Dartmouth can provide perfect weather to play winter sports. On the warm and nice days of spring, people enjoy walking and jogging outside, as well as just lying and chilling on the big grass area called ""the Green."" All in all, Dartmouth would definitely provide a nice escape for those who have grown tired of the crowded city environment.","As people say, Dartmouth is located ""in the middle of nowhere."" There are several shops and restaurants on the small street in front of the school, but the number is nothing to compare to that of Shinchon. Although students would have dinner at one of those off-campus restaurants from time to time, they are hardly tempted to go outside to hang out at nights, as students at Shinchon normally do. Looking on the other side, though, it''s a very cozy environment--you''ll become familiar with the whole area if you walk a bit around.","While most students live in the dorm, some students choose alternative housing options, such as Sustainable Living Center, Language Houses, fraternities/sororities, and so on. The number of students living off-campus is small compared to other schools. Except for few, dorm rooms are usually spacious enough for a person to live in, whether he/she is given a single or double. Each dorm is part of a larger residential cluster, which organizes independent activities including cooking or trivia nights.
All students are required to be on one of the dining plans, whose costs range from $875 (off-campus) to $1,658 per term. As this cost might indicate, the price of food at dining halls is pretty expensive, but as students pay the dining fee in advance, they don''t usually care how much money is paid when their ID cards are swiped. The quality of food at dining halls is nice, but quite a number of students get easily thrilled when their friends ask them to eat off-campus. Those who want to cook a decent meal by themselves should get the ingredients from the co-op, which is about 20-25 minutes of walk from the center of the campus.","Dartmouth has distinguished undergraduate programs in various fields of study. It also provides some courses not available in Yonsei, such as Native American Studies and African/African American Studies, so any student interested in those subjects might well take an advantage of the rare opportunity. Students usually take 2-4 courses per term, which goes on for ten weeks. The overall workload depends the courses one takes, but taking three courses each term, I often found the amount of reading and homework quite overwhelming. Since each term is very fast-paced, it might feel that the term is over as soon as it started, so it''s important to make any non-academic plans, such as taking trip over the weekend to a nearby town or even to Boston, in advance--otherwise, one might spend a whole term away struggling with the readings and problem sets.
Dartmouth has several libraries with a wide collection of books and nice facilities. Although libraries get crowded during the exam period, one might find a place to study in one of these study areas. Baker-Berry, the main library on campus, also has a snack bar where one can make a quick meal, a multi-media center where one can edit a movie and borrow a DVD, and a tower that has great nice view of the campus (sadly, the tower only opens at certain times of the year). Some places in Baker-Berry reminded me of a scene from Harry Potter, which was quite an excitement.","The Office of Visa and Immigration Services (OVIS) takes care of the visa status of every international student, but its concerns are pretty much limited to the administrative issues. There is not a visible department or any other type of institution that primarily deals with international education; however, since there is an increasing number of international students on campus, they can easily seek for any kinds of help when needed. International Student Association (ISA) organizes many events and activities to share the different culture of various international students.","Performances, ensembles, and films are always available at the Hopkins Center (the Hop), and the tickets are offered at cheaper prices for the students. Those who want to watch a newly released film might visit a small theater called Nugget on the ""main street"" as well.
There are many clubs that hold weekly meetings and organize events on campus, but I somehow felt that club activities at Dartmouth do not take that much attention and enthusiasm from the students as they do in Korea. Joining a sports team might be different since it basically requires a regular time commitment of at least two hours a day.","Having lived in Korea for my entire life, I had been constantly amazed by the different culture while I was in the States. One thing I noticed was that American people are nice to strangers in general. People casually say hi to strangers, hold the door for the next person, and slow down their cars for pedestrians. I''ve also noticed, however, that people in America are used to using plastic dishes and utensils and don''t really recycle. Although people were making efforts to make the campus more sustainable, it seemed that they had a long way to go on that initiative.","One of the things I would really recommend that all the Yonsei exchange students at Dartmouth do is to take part in a friendship family program. Through this program, I got to meet a really nice couple living near the campus, and they helped me a lot with all sorts of things. Besides being able to get rides to a nearby place, I also got a great emotional support whenever I met them and visited their place. We had meals together on a regular basis and took daily trips to several places on weekends. They also taught me a great deal about American culture, which was very interesting. I still keep in touch with them through email, and hope to see them again sometime in the near future.","Be adventurous and try out as many things as possible! Although I tried to cherish every moment I had at Dartmouth, I still have so many regrets on what I didn''t do. And one useful tip on traveling: check out http://couchsurfing.org and try to meet local people when you travel around. I couchsurfed while I was visiting Chicago with my friend during the spring break, met wonderful hosts, and had such a great time.
I really really appreciate that I was given a chance to experience a year of Dartmouth. I learned a lot from the classes and had unforgettable experiences--but above all, I am really grateful that I could make some lifelong friends there."
"With an undergraduate enrollment of only slightly over 4,000 students, Dartmouth College is the smallest school in the Ivy League.  The school is located in the northeastern part of the USA. Hanover – the surrounding town - is a little college town of 11,000 situated in a lovely region of western New Hampshire. The Appalachian Trail runs right through downtown, and the town sits on the Connecticut River, a favorite for canoeists. Expectedly, there is incredible access to the outdoor adventures: trail access, snowshoeing, skiing and paddling. Dartmouth even has its own golf course, canoe club and alpine and Nordic ski areas, all open to the public. My first 5 days at Dartmouth, I participated in an outdoor, pre-orientation trip organized by the Dartmouth Outing Club (DOC) - the oldest collegiate outing club in the USA - for incoming students (freshmen, transfer, exchange). Over the course of 5 days I hiked almost 20 miles and saw gorgeous sights that are truly unique on Dartmouth’s 24000 acre land grant.Hanover experiences a continental climate with long, cold, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The climate changes every year, indeed Hanover’s weather has been well-known for its unpredictability. During my year there (2010-2011), it was coldest in February with the temperature as low as – 35 degrees Celsius. We had a lot of snow storms, the last one on April 1st. The weather starts getting cold in late September, early October and becomes warm again in late April, early May.","Dartmouth, a residential college, offers a different feel from Yonsei – a commuter school. More than 90% students live in on-campus housing, which includes residence halls, fraternity and sorority houses, college-approved coeds, and undergraduate societies. After spending 2 years in a big and cosmopolitan city that is Seoul, it was a nice “escape” to the little town of Hanover and experience what a typical American college life is like. I have found the school to be incredibly welcoming and friendly, especially to newcomers, from day one. At first it was beyond my understanding how people trapped in that small town in the middle of nowhere, could love the school with so much passion. Gradually and eventually, I experienced first-hand the reasons why. There is a great sense of community, and seeing how much school spirit people have at sporting events, it was easy to get pulled into the culture and love Dartmouth as much as everybody else does. I think it is the combination of the quaint, small-town feel, and the friendly, quirky people, and the Greek society culture, and the feeling of being literally trapped in a college bubble - albeit voluntarily and all the while enjoying it - makes Dartmouth so special. What distinguish Dartmouth from other schools are undoubtedly students. This is, in my opinion, the biggest benefit of attending an Ivy League school. Since the prestige of the school draws so many talented applicants, Dartmouth presents you with a class of incredible individuals – a very rewarding aspect about the education here. The excellence of other students pushes you hard and keeps on making you better. I am always amazed at the things that people do whenever I meet with someone. Every individual here is really that unique. If you were to ask me if there is a typical Dartmouth student, I would say no. It’s really diverse here.With a rural setting and close community, Dartmouth displays a sense of unity and fun. The isolation from urban areas encourages participation in athletics and the school’s Greek system. Students are well-known for preserving a variety of strong time-honored campus traditions. There is a prominent big weekend event every term – Homecoming Bonfire (main geared toward freshmen), Winter Carnival, Green Key and Fieldstock during Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer terms respectively. As for the social scene, approximately 60% of students are members of Greek organizations, which serve as the hubs of social life at Dartmouth. Exchange students are also offered the chance to rush and join a sorority or fraternity during fall or winter term. The Greek life is noticeably the most dominant – but definitely not the only social option. There are always other social events, such as world class performances for a very reasonable price (usually $5 for students) at the Hopkins Center of the Art, free food, and other events which don’t require drinking. There is an impressive system of libraries, museums, performance venues and galleries provide for a rich cultural life at the school.  With over 200 student organizations and clubs on campus, you are presented with overwhelming activities that attending 3 or 4 of them can already take away the majority of your time. So if you are worried about the location of the college or the frat culture, don’t be - the institution does provide you many diverse opportunities to socialize and get involved on campus.","Most of the exchange students are accommodated in halls of residence located on campus and participate in the school’s dining plan. Housing is generally pre-arranged based on a questionnaire you completed in your application.  Mclaughlin Cluster, the dorm I was housed in for all 3 terms, was the newest residential building and very well equipped with multiple shower rooms, large kitchen on each floor, spacious study lounges and laundry room conveniently located in the basement. I was in a two-room double with a roommate who was also an exchange student from Mount Holyoke College (MA). Generally, it was at most 15 minutes walk away from my dorm to classes, dining centers, the gym, other dorm building, fraternities or town. Many other exchange students also live in either McLaughlin or Butterfied, which is more centrally located. The school also offers interim housing for breaks between the terms, and as an international student you will almost always be guaranteed spaces.There are dining halls in different buildings. Dartmouth has one main dining building named Class of 1953 Commons where most people eat the majority of their meals. There is a relatively good selection of food (grill, hot meals, deli and sandwiches, salad bar, ice cream, bottled drinks, kosher food, stir-fry, etc …). There is also food offered in the Courtyard cafe in the Hopkins center (usually referred to as the Hop, the school’s arts building) and cafe in the library. Collis, the student center, also has food for breakfast, throughout the day, and also late at night (until 12:30 AM) on Sunday through Thursday. Off campus, there is a main street that extends from Dartmouth, which has a good variety of restaurants (Japanese, Korean, American, Chinese, Indian, Mexican …). Generally housing costs about $2100 per term, and there is a new pay-per-meal dining plan with all-you-can-eat style option that will come into effects starting Fall 2011, with starting cost at around $1600 per term.","In terms of academic calendar, Dartmouth operates around the D-plan; which means that it runs by terms. Each term is 10 weeks long, and each student normally takes 3 classes per term, maximum of 4 classes/term. Compared to the usual 6-course workload at Yonsei, this educational experience appears breezy at first – but the pace of the classes is much faster. . On average you will only have 12 hours of class a week. The term goes by so fast that what other colleges learn in a semester long, you are covering in 10 weeks. However, you are only taking 3 classes so that balances out. The grading system is similar to that of Yonsei, and the teaching methods consist of lecturing, using the board and power points, just as at Yonsei. The students are bright and very actively in class. Nevertheless, the generally feel is not that competitive and cut-throat, so learning is more relaxing in regards to being in class and working with other students. Final grades are given on a letter scale – A, B, C, D or E (failure). Pluses and minuses can be added to B, C or D and minuses to an A. Unlike Yonsei, Dartmouth’s highest grade is only A instead of A+, but a citation can be rewarded in addition to a grade for a particular student in the class as a way of adding luster to the highest possible grade.The classes I took during my time there were mostly from the Government, Geography, History, Women & Gender Studies and Psychology departments. Specifically, they were Environment and Politics in Southeast Asia, European Union Foreign Relations, Introduction to LGBT Studies (Fall 2010), Immigration Asylum and Politics, Human Rights and International Relations, Social Psychology (Winter 2011), Media and Advertising in American Politics, American Foreign Relations since 1990, Introduction to International Development (Spring 2011). Dartmouth is mostly undergraduate-focused (besides Tuck school of Business, other grad schools are not that popular). The student-faculty ratio at Dartmouth College is 8:1, one of the best in the country. You are given opportunities to engage in independent research through numerous grants that the college gives out, and even exchange students are eligible to apply in certain cases depending on your major department. So for those of you who enjoy doing research, there are plenty at Dartmouth. Dartmouth's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs. Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business & Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Kresge Physical Sciences Library, Paddock Music Library, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, comprising Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and Berry Library (opened 2000). The library is open until 2 AM daily and 24 hours during reading period and finals.","The Office of Visa and Immigration Services (OVIS) specializes on international students. They were very accommodating in guiding me through the visa application process before arrival, as well as helping me acquire an off-campus working permit after my program ended because I was able to find an internship in New York over the summer. Each exchange student is also assigned to an Academic Dean that could help you with your academic concerns. Generally, support services were available if needed, but I didn't need/use them as much. My experience with them was overall very good and satisfactory.","During orientation week, there will be a campus recycling sale! There will be hundreds of second-hand items that graduating students left behind that you can buy at very cheap price. For example, a small dorm fridge costs only $15-25, 10 cloth hangers for just $1, among many other things. The International Student Association will also hold a trip to nearby grocery store where you can buy blanket and pillows etc. There will also be a poster sale if you like to decorate your room.As an international student on J-1 visa, I was eligible for on-campus employment as long as it doesn’t exceed 20 hours/week. All 3 terms, I worked 2 jobs – one was student assistant at the Hopkins Center where I stage-managed shows and performances, and the other was working at one of the dining halls. On average I earned $9/hour and got  20% discount for meals because of my employment with the dining service.","The transition into American culture as a whole, for me, was easy. Since I've been in the States before, I find it easy to adjust and make friends. I realize, however, that I can never escape the international community, but I don't really mind. And I notice that here it's one of those things that when you tell people you're international they are so amazed that you've made it at Dartmouth and they value you much more.  Whenever asked where I'm from, I’d reply ""Vietnam and Korea"".","Hanover is a little college town and I never once felt unsafe, even when walking home (sometimes alone) late at night from a friend's dorm or from parties. The health center is also very accessible. Dartmouth College offers a number of student services including tutoring, women's center, placement service, health service, and health insurance. Dartmouth College also offers campus safety and security services like 24-hour foot and vehicle patrols, late night transport/escort service, 24-hour emergency telephones, lighted pathways/sidewalks, and controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc).","The courses offered at Dartmouth are very diverse and of different topics, but make sure to confirm with your department at Yonsei about the classes you intend to take so that your credit transfer procedure will be easier. Yonsei typically requires you to find equivalent classes at Yonsei in order for course credit obtained at Dartmouth to be transferred to your major program.I also want to highlight DOC Trip as the must-experience Dartmouth traditions. I basically fell in love with Dartmouth from the very first week I came here just because of the five-day trip into the New Hampshire wild with 2 upperclassmen trip leaders and 5 to 7 fellow incoming students (called “trippees”). You'll meet so many people on your trip and other groups within the same section. As an international student you can only go on section G and H. My trip was F03 – Easy hiking.Overall, I wholeheartedly enjoyed my time at Dartmouth and miss the school dearly now that my exchange program has ended. My time away has definitely been a period of self-reflection. Wherever you decide to go for your study abroad program, I’m certain that you will have an amazing time as well. And if it’s Dartmouth, I can absolute guarantee that you will be in for a whole lot of excitement and opportunities ahead. Best of luck and enjoy!"
"Dartmouth College는 소규모의 liberal arts college입니다. 작은 학교이기 때문에 (학부 전교생이 6000명 정도) 대부분의 강의가 정원수가 30명 안팎이어서 쾌적한 수업 분위기에서 공부할 수 있고 수업시간 내 토론도 활발하게 진행됩니다. Dartmouth는 큰 university가 아닌 소규모 liberal arts college, 즉 teaching college으로서 유명한데, 이는 교수진이 학생들에게 학업과 관련해서 많은 관심과 조언을 줄 수 있기 때문입니다.
  Dartmouth College는 New Hampshire주에 작은 도시인 Hanover에 위치해 있습니다. Vermont와 근접해있고 가장 가까운 대도시는 2시간 반 떨어져있는 Boston입니다. 
  기후는 여름, 가을, 봄에는 매우 좋습니다. 다만 11월-3월에는 기온이 영하 23도C 이하로 떨어지고 눈이 많이 오기 때문에 눈장화(snow boots), 장갑, 목도리, 두꺼운 웃옷, 모자 등이 필수입니다.","Hanover는 매우 작은 도시이기 때문에 상업이 크게 발달해 있지 않습니다. Downtown에는 레스토랑이 7-8곳 정도 있고, 부티크 옷가게 3-4곳, 슈퍼 1곳 등이 있습니다. Hanover는 시골이기 때문에 유통비가 비싸서 전반적으로 물가가 매우 높습니다. 따라서 생필품 또는 가전제품을 사려면 30분 정도 떨어져 있는 West Lebannon으로 가야 합니다. 그곳에는 Walmart, Kmart, BJ''s등이 있기 때문에 저렴한 가격에 필요한 것을 살 수 있습니다. 하지만 웬만한 생필품과 groceries는 캠퍼스에 위치한 Topside에서도 구매할 수 있습니다. Dining plan(DBA)에 Topside에서 사용할 수 있는 $200이 포함됩니다.
  학교가 대도시와 멀리 떨어진 시골에 위치하고 있기 때문에 주변 자연경관이 매우 아름다울 뿐 아니라 캠퍼스에서 다양한 야외활동을 즐길 수 있습니다. 여름이나 봄에 캠퍼스 옆으로 흐르는 White River에서 카누/카약을 탈 수 있고, 캠퍼스 잔디에서 Frisbee 놀이를 하고, cross-country, horseback-riding 등을 모두 할 수 있습니다. 또, 겨울에는 셔틀버스로 15분 거리에 있는 학교 스키장에서 스키, 스노우보드, 썰매 등 겨울 스포츠도 즐길 수 있습니다.","Dartmouth는 residential campus이기 때문에 거의 모든 학생이 campus 기숙사에서 거주합니다. Single room 부터 One-room-Double, Two-room-Double, Suite 등이 있으며 대부분의 기숙사는 강의실에서 3분-15분 거리에 있습니다. 교환학생은 대부분 Two-room-Double을 배정받지만 본인이 원할 경우에 Office of Residential Life에 미리 요청하여 Single room을 배정받을 수 있습니다.
  식사는 학교 학생증에 충전돼 있는 (학기 시작 전 기숙사비 납부할 때 포함) 1200불 가량의 DBA를 사용해서 Hopkins, Thayer Dining Hall (Homeplate, Pavillian''s, Foco), Collis, Novack Snack Bar 등 교내 Cafeteria에서 식사를 할 수 있습니다. Salad/Fruit Bar, Grill Bar, Sandwich Bar, Today''s Special, Dessert Bar, Smoothies Parlor등이 다양하게 준비 되어 있기 때문에 개인이 잘 선택해서 이용하기만 하면 건강하고 영양가 높은 식생활을 할 수 있습니다.
  가끔씩 학교음식이 식상하면 한국/일본 레스토랑인 Yama에서 한식을, EBA''s에서 피자를, 중국식인 Orient나, Jewel of India에서 인도카레를 배달/주문해서 식사를 할 수 있습니다. 가격은 대부분 $15 에서 $23 (15% 팁 포함) 사이에 분포합니다.","Dartmouth는 residential campus이기 때문에 거의 모든 학생이 campus 기숙사에서 거주합니다.

9월 학기 시작 전에 있는 International Orientation은 국제교환학생들뿐 아니라 신입 외국인 유학생들을 대상으로 진행됩니다. 따라서 프로그램이 교환학생들을 위한다기 보다 신입생들의 안정적인 대학생활의 시작을 도와주는 내용 위주로 구성되어 있습니다. 교환학생으로서 Dartmouth에 갔을 때에는 이미 3학년인 연세대 학생들에게는 오리엔테이션 내용이 대학교 입학 당시 받았던 오리엔테이션 교육내용과 중복될 수도 있습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 학기 시작 전에 다른 국제학생들을 만날 수 있는 기회이기 때문에 참여하는 것도 나쁘지 않다고 생각합니다.","Dartmouth에는 Gym, 테니스장, 농구장, 미식축구장, 수영장, 승마장, 스키장 등과 같이 학생들이 다양한 스포츠를 즐길 수 있도록 여가시설이 매우 잘 갖추어져 있습니다. 바쁜 학기 중에도 잘 이용하기만 하면 굉장히 많은 다양한 여가활동을 즐길 수 있습니다.
Healthcare Center로는 Dick’s House가 있습니다. Dartmouth에 가기 전 가을학기 기숙사비를 지불할 때 함께 2000불 정도의 1년간의 의료보험료를 내게 되는데, 이는 웬만한 약 처방, 예방접종비용, 진료비를 다 포함하기 때문에 Dick’s House의 의료서비스를 적극 이용할 것을 추천합니다. 감기에 걸렸을 때뿐 아니라 다양한 예방접종이 필요할 때 전화로 예약해서 찾아가면 의료보험에 해당되는 항목에 한해서 의료서비스를 무상으로 제공해줍니다. (2009년 당시에는 신종플루 백신접종을 무상으로 제공해주었습니다.) 게다가 학생들에게 매우 친절하고 아픈 곳이 있으면 적극적으로 도와주기 때문에 아프면 절대 혼자서 고생하지 말고 바로 Dick’s House에 전화해서 상담을 받거나 예약을 해서 practitioner를 만나는 것이 좋습니다.

Dartmouth에 있을 때 학업을 우선적으로 하여 개인적으로 어떤 특정 동아리에 가입을 하지는 않았지만 KSA (Korean Student Association) 활동에 참여하면서 현지 한국 유학생들 및 Korean American학생들과 친분을 맺었습니다. 그 밖에도 기독교 동아리 등이 있지만 대부분의 현지 미국 학생들은 Fraternity (남학생 클럽), Sorority(여학생 클럽)에 가입을 해서 활동을 합니다.","1764년에 설립된 Dartmouth는 오랜 역사를 자랑하는 유서가 깊은 Ivy League 학교입니다. Dartmouth의 동문들은 미국의 최상류층에서 활동하며 그 이름에 기여하는데, 미국사회에서 Dartmouth가 명망 있는 일류학교로 인식되는 것도 좋은 커리큘럼, 쾌적한 공부환경, 훌륭한 교수진 이외에 동문들의 큰 활약이 있기 때문입니다. 그만큼 학생들은 학교에 대해 큰 자부심을 가지고 있습니다. 
하지만 그 자부심 이면에 다소 배타적인 학교 전통이 다른 Ivy League에 비해 아직도 많이 남아있음을 느낄 수 있습니다. 그 중에 대표적인 것이 Greek Society: Fraternity (남학생 클럽) and Sorority (여학생 클럽) 문화입니다. 미국 특유의 대학 문화이기도 한 이 Fraternity 문화는 유흥시설이 존재하지 않는 시골에 위치한 Dartmouth에서 특히 더 뚜렷하게 나타납니다. Fraternity, Sorority 클럽들은 그 회원가입이 쉽지 않아 배타적인 집단으로 인식되기도 하지만 이들이 여는 주말의 댄스파티와 Beer Pong 파티는 다른 학생들이 주중의 공부로 인해 받은 스트레스를 풀 수 있는 유일한 출구이기도 합니다. 이렇게 파티 문화의 주축을 이루는 Fraternity, Sorority 문화가 국제교환학생들에게는 낯설게 다가올 수도 있지만 “Rushing”이라는 과정을 통한 클럽가입을 시도해서 직접 그 문화에 참여해 보는 것도 하나의 경험이 될 수 있다고 생각합니다. 어쨌든, 미국사회에서 Dartmouth 동문들이 끈끈한 연을 유지할 수 있는 것도 같은 House출신의 Brother들, Sister들을 밀어주기 때문이라고 합니다. 그런 면에서는 우리나라 대학 내 학회활동, 동아리활동을 통해 맺은 선후배 관계와 비슷하다고 볼 수 있습니다.","학교 행정부처로는 Office of Visa and Immigration Services (OVIS), Office of Registrar, Office of Residential Life, Academic Dean, Dick’s House (Healthcare Center) 등이 있으며 각각 비자관련 업무, 수강신청/변경 및 trascript관련 업무, 기숙사생활관련 문제, 학업상담, 건강 등에 대해서 찾아가 도움을 요청할 수 있습니다. 그리고 그 외로 도움이 필요하면 얘기하고 의지할 수 있는 KSA의 한국인 유학생, 그리고 Korean American 친구들이 있습니다. ^^","Ivy League 대학에서는 첫 한인 총장인 Jim Kim 총장이 2009년 취임하면서 Dartmouth는 우리나라에서도 인지도가 높아졌고 요즘에는 점점 더 많은 명성을 얻고 있습니다. 제가 교환학생으로서 경험했던 Dartmouth는 명문의 Ivy League답게 수업과 교수님들, 그리고 캠퍼스 시설 모두 기대를 저버리지 않습니다. 하지만 제가 Dartmouth에 가서 학생들을 보며 가장 놀랬고 닮고 싶었던 점은 공부도 열심히 하면서 다양한 활동을 통해 열심히 노는 모습이었습니다. 많은 양의 과제를 능숙하게 해내면서 동시에 여가를 신나게 즐기는 그들의 인생관과 효율성을 보면서 많은 점을 배웠습니다. 이러한 시간관리 능력과 인맥, 그리고 인생을 즐길 줄 아는 가치관이 Dartmouth 학생들이 사회에 진출해서 성공할 수 있게 만드는 것이라고 생각합니다. Dartmouth에서 보낸 길고도 짧은 1년 동안 새롭고 낯선 환경에서 적응하면서, 높은 수준의 학업성취에 도전하면서 내적으로 많이 성장한 제 자신을 발견할 수 있었습니다. 이런 점에서 Dartmouth로 교환학생을 다녀온 것은 후회 없는 선택이었고, 다른 연세대 학생에게도 추천하고 싶은 경험입니다. &#61514;"
"Dartmouth College is a small Ivy League liberal-arts institution located in the town of Hanover, New Hampshire. With only 6,000 students, Dartmouth's total enrollment is fairly small compared to Yonsei University. Combine the isolated New Hampshire wilderness (by wilderness I mean mountains, forests, lakes, bears, and mooses!) and a small population, and you have a natural paradise.What I like the most about Dartmouth is the overwhelming sense of community. Everybody is a part of the Dartmouth community, or the so-called Dartmouth ""bubble"". People here know how to welcome you, and they do it extremely well! I fell in love with this college from the very first day we had this 5-day trip into the wild called DOC and then followed by a week of orientation. Into the semester, too, Dartmouth always has something going on each week. Again, all these are the desirable consequence of having a small student population isolated from the world. You got no other choice but to set your own fun and get along with the ""few"" people around you.Weather in Hanover starts to get cold from early September. The first day I got there was freezing cold, and you better get ready. Fortunately, the winter I was there was unusually warmer but I heard it could get really bad.","The region around Dartmouth, Hanover, is known as the Upper Valley. Upper Valley is a collection of small towns in the border area of the State of New Hampshire and Vermont, with the Connecticut River dividing the region in two. In fact, Hanover is located right next to the River and from Spring to Fall many Dartmouth people swim, canoe, and kayak along the River.Dartmouth boasts the natural surroundings of primarily untouched mountains and forests. Here is an escape from bustling city life, all sorts of pollution, and headaches that you often find in big universities and big cities. You have an unlimited supply of fresh air and here, too, you find the best definition of what ""as white as snow"" can mean. True, Spring might not be as colorful as Yonsei, or Korea for that matter, but for Fall and Winter the sceneries are unmatched.While at Dartmouth, you should make use of the opportunities to travel and hike the mountains around the campus, from the nearby Fire Tower, or hike Mt. Mousilauke. If you like outdoors, from hiking, horseback riding, to skiing, then this is the place for you!Other than what New Hampshire nature has to offer, there is not much else to do. The closest metropolitan city is Boston, which is 2-3 hours away by car. Some choose to go all the way down to Boston to shop and get a haircut, although we do have local barber. But again, Hanover is only a small town. It might be a bit challenging if you're too used to city life. But hey, you'll see that there's more to life than cities!In Upper Valley, there is a non-profit local bus service that can take you to other towns. There are usually many people who drive at Dartmouth, depending on the person but usually it is normal to ask for friends to drive you to other towns.","As an exchange student, housing is already pre-arranged before your arrival. There is not much option living off-campus. Usually Dartmouth provides the best housing to exchange students and you don't have to undergo the competitive process of housing assignment applied to regular students.At Dartmouth, there are many different types of rooms. For exchange students, however, it's usually if not always the two-room double assignment where you will basically have your own room and a roommate who has his/her own room too. It's just that he/she lives right next door to you. There is a kitchen, fridge, TV lounge, study lounge, and multiple shower rooms on every floor, a laundry and huge commons on each building. The heating is perfect, as long as you have enough blanket.Dartmouth requires every student to have a meal plan. The exchange is for three terms (one year), and each term you have to pay around $2100 for housing and $1200 for the meal plan. These are fixed, the meal plan can be more expensive (if you choose to have a larger deal) but the housing is pretty much fixed. Here and there you will hear people complaining about the food in the cafetaria, but really there's not much to complain about. The food is nice and good, with a lot of variety. Dining is concentrated at three different cafetarias: Food Court, Collis, and The Courtyard. Since Dartmouth is a small campus, it is almost always the case that you will meet people you know in the cafetaria.Also, make sure you check out Late Night Collis.There are few off-campus options for dinner. At Hanover, there is a Chinese, Thai, Korean/Japanese, Indian, Mexican Restaurant, and other diners. I would say on average a meal outside will cost $10. There are many more options if you go to other towns.","Being a liberal arts institution, Dartmouth offers a wide range of courses and majors. It can get really confusing when it comes to course selection period because there will be too many interesting courses and unfortunately you can only take three courses a term.In Fall 2009 I took:US Political History in the 20th Century (Prof. Ronald Edsforth)American Political Thought (Prof. James R. Muirhead)International Politics (Prof. Stephen Brooks)Winter 2010African Political Economy (Prof. Nelson Kasfir)US Foreign Policy (Prof. Brent Strethman)US Political History in the 19th Century (Prof. Robert Bonner)Spring 2010Will China Democratize (Prof. Martin Dimitrov)International Trade (Prof. Douglas Irwin)History and Culture of Indonesia (Prof. Jody Diamond)The workload is not that much different than UIC. Generally in the social science area how course evaluation works is about the same, with midterm and finals, essays, and research papers. On average you will only have 12 hours of class a week. That gives you a lot of time for your own ""further independent study"" or if you don't want to you can just spend time with club activities or just hang out with friends on the Green!Students at Dartmouth are bright, for the most part they like to participate in class and they give interesting opinion and perspective. Nonetheless, they do not seem to be that competitive, so there won't be too much pressure on you from your peers. Class atmosphere is chill.There are many libraries at Dartmouth, with the Baker-Berry being the main library. It is located at the center of the campus. Every once in a while the tower bell is opened for visit and tour. From there you can have the 360 degree view of Dartmouth campus. The library has a complete collection of books and various study area. The atmosphere is not as strict as Yonsei library.","The only office that specializes on international students is the Office of Visa and Immigration Services (OVIS) that will guide you in applying for visa and getting a working permit at Dartmouth. Other than that, for other needs and questions, from class registration, housing, gymnasium utility, etc. you can go directly to each respective administrative office. They are all very friendly. You can just send an email to them, and they are very quick in replying. Don't worry, whenever you have problems or questions these people are there to help you.In addition to that, you will also be assigned to an Academic Dean who will be responsible to give you any advice you need. All the Academic Deans work at Parkhust. You can schedule an appointment through email.","Dartmouth has a complete list of facilities open for students use.The gym has a fitness center with instructor, swimming pools, indoor basketball court, indoor squash and racquetball courts, fencing and boxing room, indoor soccer field, outdoor soccer field, lacrosse field, football stadium, tennis courts, etc.The Dick's Center provides health services. You can get immunizations there too. If you feel sick just make an appointment online or by phone. Dick's Center also provides counselling services for any category. Last year, they even provided free bird flu vactinations.The Hop is the center for the arts and performance at Dartmouth. You can check their website for full schedule of events and performances, from weekly movie screening, orchestra performances, musical plays, just random performing arts group visiting, or even a concert by Jason Derulo.There are hundreds of student clubs at Dartmouth, from athletics, the arts, to academic and religious clubs. The great majority of Dartmouth students are involved in one or more athletic activities. Dartmouth also has cultural clubs. You should definitely check out the International Student Association and the Korean Student Association. They organize regular events. All these clubs like to offer free food too!When I was at Dartmouth I was involved in Agape and Christian Impact, both of which are Dartmouth Christian fellowships. Even though Dartmouth, like other New England colleges, are secular, it does have a strong religious community under the umbrella of the Tucker Foundation for religious activities.Other than the facilities and clubs mentioned above, Dartmouth also has research institutions such as the Dickey Center for International Understanding and the Rockefeller Center that offer programs to students. These institutions, the academic departments, and the various student clubs also like to hold seminar events and invite distinguished guest speakers. These seminars are often my favorite and most inspiring experience I had at Dartmouth.One last thing, Dartmouth is famous for its Greek Life scene. We have at least twenty fraternities and sororities. For the most part, Greek societies serve as a place to hang out, relax, and to party. As an exchange student, you are eligible to apply, or to use their terminology ""rush"" for a membership in the Greek House. Greek House can be a large part of your exchange experience, depending on how you utilize the opportunity. I did not. It is a good place to make network at Dartmouth that will last even after you leave.","Being a foreigner who's studying in Korea (thus having experienced enough culture shock before) I find my adaptation to Dartmouth very smooth. After all, we have heard a lot about American culture and the college culture so much. So what's new?Perhaps there's nothing new! On the contrary, you probably have heard too many prejudices about America or American colleges; prejudices which often times are just flat out not true!Just an example, people like to say that Americans only speak one language. At Dartmouth, this can never be further from truth! Many people speak Chinese, Arabic, Greek, French, Swahili, you name it!Two things that strike me the most about Dartmouth are the newspaper culture and the freedom of expression. At Dartmouth you will see many publications, from the left-leaning Dartmouth Free Press to the conservative Dartmouth Review. The mainstream one is The D. It is always interesting to see what Dartmouth students have to say on issues ranging from national security to the Dartmouth Dining Service monopoly of the dining system at Dartmouth. (Dartmouth Review published a special edition just to attack DDS monopoly).The second thing is the freedom of expression at Dartmouth. Students are more free to express themselves and to voice their opinion. Maybe this is not unique to Dartmouth alone, but the dynamism I saw was unlike anything I've seen before in any other society I've been to. Surely at times this freedom can be ""violated,"" and some actions that some students do can be abhorrent to us, but for the most part witnessing this freedom can inspire you and broaden your perspective.","As stated previously, there are many administrative offices at Dartmouth willing to help you. You will also have Academic Dean to answer questions regarding school life.Outside of Dartmouth, there are local community groups (e.g. churches) that can lend you a hand. Make sure to use these community groups so as to enlarge the scope of your experience while staying there.","Two things that you should not forget to do. First is to take part in the Dartmouth Outing Club (DOC) Trip held before school begins. Trust me, this will blow your mind. It's the best thing that can ever happen in your exchange program.The next thing is to utilize the Orientation Week as best as you can. The information provided here are nothing compared to what you will get during OT. The rest, you'll learn as you go.I wish you luck with your exchange application! Your exchange program will leave an impact in your life and I hope for the best!In closing, I promise you that exchange to Dartmouth is the best you can ever get. I heartily recommend Dartmouth College to you!""Dear old Dartmouth, give a rouseFor the College on the hill,For the Lone Pine above her,And the loyal ones who love her.Give a rouse, give a rouse, with a will!For the sons of old Dartmouth,For the daughters of Dartmouth.Though‘round the girdled Earth they roam,Her spell on them remains.They have the still North in their hearts,The hill winds in their veins,And the granite of New HampshireIn their muscles and their brains.And the granite of New HampshireIn their muscles and their brains.Dear old Dartmouth, set a watch,Lest the old traditions fail.Stand as sister stands by brother.Dare a deed for the old mother.Greet the world from the hills with a hail!For the sons of old Dartmouth,For the daughters of Dartmouth.Around the world they keep for herTheir old undying faith.They have the still North in their soul,The hill winds in their breath,And the granite of New HampshireIs made part of them ‘til death.And the granite of New HampshireIS MADE PART OF THEM 'TIL DEATH."""
